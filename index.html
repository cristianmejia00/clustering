<section id="cluster-1-climate-change-impacts-and-adaptation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-1-climate-change-impacts-and-adaptation">Cluster 1: Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation</h4>
<p>The common topic of the cluster is climate change and its impacts on various aspects such as precipitation patterns, flood risk, hydrological modeling, and regional climate projections. The texts discuss the projections of climate change in the Mediterranean region, the potential to reduce uncertainty in regional climate predictions, downscaling techniques for hydrological modeling, global flood risk, and the assessment of climate change impacts on hydrology. They also touch upon the importance of adaptation, the role of climate models in predicting future climate, and the need for effective floodplain management strategies. Overall, the cluster provides insights into the current understanding of climate change and its implications for different regions and sectors.<br>
<strong>Articles:</strong><br>
Climate change projections for the Mediterranean region indicate a decrease in precipitation, particularly in the warm season, except for the northern Mediterranean areas in winter, due to increased anticyclonic circulation and a northward shift of the Atlantic storm track, along with a pronounced warming, maximum in the summer season, leading to a greater occurrence of extremely high temperature events, with the projections by global and regional models generally consistent but with substantial orographically-induced fine scale structure in the regional models, suggesting that the Mediterranean might be an especially vulnerable region to global change. <span class="citation" data-cites="giorgi-2008-climate-change">(<a href="#ref-giorgi-2008-climate-change" role="doc-biblioref">Giorgi and Lionello 2008</a>)</span> <code>degree: 176</code> <code>citations: 2045</code><br>

Future scenarios of concurrent long-duration dry and hot (LDDH) events in China during summer were investigated using fourteen global climate models (GCMs) downscaled by four statistical downscaling methods. The downscaling methods improved the accuracy of LDDH characteristics and the three quantile mapping based techniques outperformed the cumulative distribution function transform. All downscaling methods projected an increasing tendency for the frequency, magnitude, and total days of LDDH events in China, with higher increases under RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5. Model uncertainty dominated throughout the century, but scenario uncertainty became more important towards the end of the century for the projection of temperature magnitude of LDDH events. <span class="citation" data-cites="yang-2023-downscaling-and">(<a href="#ref-yang-2023-downscaling-and" role="doc-biblioref">Y.

Validation of species-climate impact models under climate change is crucial due to the significant variability in model predictions and the need to reduce uncertainties; however, model validation is challenging as predictions are made for future events, and current approaches suffer from spatial and temporal autocorrelation issues. In this study, using observed distribution shifts among 116 British breeding-bird species over the past 20 years, four envelope modelling techniques were independently validated, showing good to fair predictive performance, although the interpretation of model performance in a decision-planning context is difficult. Artificial neural networks and generalized additive models outperformed generalized linear models and classification tree analysis in predicting species range shifts. While perfect validation may not be conceptually possible, the usefulness of models depends on the questions being asked and the techniques used. <span class="citation" data-cites="araujo-2005-validation-species-climate">(<a href="#ref-araujo-2005-validation-species-climate" role="doc-biblioref">Araujo et al. 2005</a>)</span> <code>degree: 249</code> <code>citations: 1115</code><br>
This study examines the patterns and uncertainties of species’ range shifts under climate change, finding that while there is high potential for species turnover in response to climate change, the variability in projections arising from different niche-based models obscures the potential distributional changes of species across climate scenarios, highlighting the need to explicitly quantify model uncertainty when discussing future species distributions and community descriptors. The study also proposes and tests an alternative method to account for modelling variability when estimating species turnover under different climate change scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="thuiller-2004-patterns-and">(<a href="#ref-thuiller-2004-patterns-and" role="doc-biblioref">Thuiller 2004</a>)</span> <code>degree: 172</code> <code>citations: 630</code><br>

This study utilized eBird and GBIF data to develop Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and predict the potential impacts of climate change on terrestrial avifauna in India. The findings suggest that a significant proportion of bird species in India will shift to higher elevations or northward, resulting in changes in their distribution ranges. Additionally, bird species diversity is expected to increase in regions above 2500 m in elevation, and the western Himalayas, Sikkim, northeast India, and the western Ghats regions are predicted to experience extensive changes in species richness by 2070. These results align with predictions made for avifauna in other regions, such as Europe and the USA. <span class="citation" data-cites="deomurari-2023-projected-shifts">(<a href="#ref-deomurari-2023-projected-shifts" role="doc-biblioref">Deomurari et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 30</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>
Future scenarios of habitat suitability for the critically endangered plant species Commiphora wightii in India indicate that its potentially suitable bioclimatic distribution will increase under all future projections (2090 &gt; 2050 ≈ current), except for 2070, suggesting that there are more suitable habitats available for artificial cultivation and future projections. Additionally, the species was found to favor various types of landforms outside rocky environments, such as sand dunes, sandy plains, and saline areas.

This article highlights the need for a fundamental change in thinking and practice of environmental management, as evidence suggests that natural and social systems behave in nonlinear ways and are strongly coupled. The concept of resilience, defined as the capacity to buffer change, learn, and develop, is proposed as a framework for sustaining and enhancing adaptive capacity in a rapidly transforming world. The use of structured scenarios and active adaptive management is recommended as tools for resilience-building, which require a flexible social context with open institutions and multi-level governance systems to increase adaptive capacity and preserve future development options. <span class="citation" data-cites="folke-2002-resilience-and">(<a href="#ref-folke-2002-resilience-and" role="doc-biblioref">Folke et al. 2002</a>)</span> <code>degree: 18</code> <code>citations: 1605</code><br>

The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) aims to address scientific gaps from previous phases and fill specific knowledge gaps by utilizing the DECK and CMIP historical simulations, CMIP data standards, and a set of CMIP6-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will focus on future climate scenarios, addressing questions related to Earth system response to forcing, model biases, and assessing future climate changes given variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="eyring-2016-overview-the">(<a href="#ref-eyring-2016-overview-the" role="doc-biblioref">Eyring et al. 2016</a>)</span> <code>degree: 400</code> <code>citations: 3501</code><br>
The Precision-Recall (PR) plot should be favored over the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) plot when evaluating binary classifiers on imbalanced datasets, as the ROC plot can be misleading in these scenarios due to an incorrect interpretation of specificity, while the PR plot accurately predicts future classification performance by evaluating the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. This has implications for the interpretation of numerous studies that utilize ROC plots on imbalanced datasets. <span class="citation" data-cites="saito-2015-precision-recall-plot">(<a href="#ref-saito-2015-precision-recall-plot" role="doc-biblioref">Saito and Rehmsmeier 2015</a>)</span> <code>degree: 4</code> <code>citations: 1512</code><br>
A new scenario framework for climate change research, called Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), combines future radiative forcing and socioeconomic development pathways to study climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. SSPs are reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in society and ecosystems, and a space of challenges to adaptation and mitigation is defined within the framework. The development of basic SSPs, which can be extended for specific purposes, is proposed, along with an iterative process of application that may lead to modifications of the initial SSPs.

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is a key component of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that aims to provide multi-model climate projections based on different future emissions and land use scenarios, with the goal of enhancing understanding of the climate system and informing societal responses to climate change. The project will investigate various scientific and policy questions, including the role of specific forcings, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 degrees C, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. The design of ScenarioMIP consists of eight alternative scenarios, an initial condition ensemble, and long-term extensions, organized into two tiers based on priority. Emissions and land use scenarios will be provided to climate modeling groups by late 2016, with climate model simulations and analysis to be conducted between 2017 and 2020. <span class="citation" data-cites="o">(<a href="#ref-o" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>o?</strong></a>’neill-2016-scenario-model)</span> <code>degree: 361</code> <code>citations: 1256</code><br>

<p>The common topic of the cluster is the impact of climate change on agricultural systems, specifically on cropping systems and food production. The articles discuss various aspects such as the effects of elevated CO2 and climate change on crop yields, the consequences of climate change on global food production and hunger, methane production by ruminants contributing to global warming, the role of crop diversification in building resilience, the impact of climate change on global wine quality, methodologies for simulating climate change impacts on crop production, the impact of climate change on winter chill in fruit orchards, the timing of heat and drought stress in spring barley, and the water footprint of wheat production in a semi-arid environment. Overall, the articles highlight the need for adaptation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices in the face of climate change. Therefore, the common topic can be named as “Climate Change and its Impacts on Agricultural Systems and Food Production”.<br>

This study examined the potential effects of future climate change, including a doubling of atmospheric CO2, on agricultural production of four different cropping systems at two locations in Italy. The results showed that without modifications to current management practices, the combined effects of elevated CO2 and climate change would lead to a decrease in crop yields by 10-40%. However, adaptation strategies such as early planting and the use of slower-maturing cultivars can help maintain current crop yields. For irrigated crops, additional water may be required to mitigate the impact of climate change on grain yields. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper analyzes the global consequences of climate change on crop yields, production, and the risk of hunger under different socio-economic and emissions scenarios. The study uses climate change scenarios developed from the HadCM3 global climate model and evaluates the impacts on crop yields and global cereal production using transfer functions derived from crop model simulations. The results show complex regional patterns of climate variables, CO2 effects, and agricultural systems that contribute to changes in global crop production. The findings suggest that while the world can continue to feed itself under the scenarios considered, there will be significant regional disparities, with poorer nations facing higher prices and increased risk of hunger, particularly under scenarios of greater inequality. The study also highlights the non-linearities in the world food supply system, both in terms of biophysical impacts and socio-economic factors.

This study found that from 1950 to 1999, the warming trends in the majority of the world’s highest quality wine-producing regions led to increased vintage quality ratings and decreased year-to-year variation, with climate playing a significant role in quality variations; however, future scenarios indicate that the impacts of climate change will not be uniform across all varieties and regions, with European regions currently near their optimum growing season temperatures and New World viticulture regions showing less defined relationships, and model predictions suggesting an average warming of 2 degrees C in the next 50 years for global wine producing regions, which could exceed the climatic threshold for some regions producing high quality grapes at the margins of their climatic limits, making the ripening of balanced fruit for existing varieties and wine styles increasingly difficult, while pushing other regions into more optimal climatic regimes for the production of current varietals and potentially opening up more poleward locations for grape growing and wine production. <span class="citation" data-cites="jones-2005-climate-change">(<a href="#ref-jones-2005-climate-change" role="doc-biblioref">Jones et al. 2005</a>)</span> <code>degree: 72</code> <code>citations: 765</code><br>
The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) is an international initiative that aims to improve crop and economic models, as well as climate impact projections, in order to enhance food security and adaptation capacity in light of climate change. By linking climate, crop, and economic models, AgMIP seeks to analyze the effects of climate variability on agriculture and develop strategies for adaptation. The project provides protocols and guidelines for research activities, and pilot studies have shown the importance of considering uncertainties in climate scenarios and model choices when assessing climate impacts on wheat yields and economic projections. Ultimately, integrating multiple models can lead to a better understanding of future agricultural scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="rosenzweig-2013-agricultural-model">(<a href="#ref-rosenzweig-2013-agricultural-model" role="doc-biblioref">Rosenzweig et al. 2013</a>)</span> <code>degree: 87</code> <code>citations: 606</code><br>
Approximately 170 papers have investigated the impact of climate change on crop production and adaptation strategies, focusing on wheat, maize, soybean, and rice, with the USA and Europe being the dominant regions studied. However, the most common approach used in simulating the response to increased CO2 levels does not consider the interacting effects of CO2, stomatal conductance, and canopy temperature, which could worsen the effects of global warming. Additionally, the assumed baseline CO2 concentration often corresponds to conditions 10-30 years earlier than the paper’s acceptance date, thereby exaggerating the relative impacts of increased CO2. Furthermore, due to the various scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions, the assumed future CO2 concentrations vary greatly, making comparisons between studies more complicated. Papers focusing on adaptation primarily examined changes in planting dates and cultivars. <span class="citation" data-cites="white-2011-methodologies-for">(<a href="#ref-white-2011-methodologies-for" role="doc-biblioref">White et al. 2011</a>)</span> <code>degree: 104</code> <code>citations: 407</code><br>

A semi-empirical approach has been developed to predict future sea-level rise by establishing a relationship between global mean surface temperature and sea-level rise, indicating that the rate of sea-level rise is proportional to the magnitude of warming above pre-Industrial Age temperatures, with a constant of 3.4 millimeters/year per degree Celsius, which leads to a projected sea-level rise in 2100 of 0.5 to 1.4 meters above the 1990 level based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s future warming scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="rahmstorf-2007-semi-empirical-approach">(<a href="#ref-rahmstorf-2007-semi-empirical-approach" role="doc-biblioref">Rahmstorf 2007</a>)</span> <code>degree: 122</code> <code>citations: 1065</code><br>
Antarctica has historically played a significant role in sea-level rise, with past warm periods resulting in much higher global mean sea levels, and the Antarctic ice sheet being identified as the primary contributor; using a model that considers various factors, including the impact of atmospheric warming on ice shelves and cliffs, researchers project that Antarctica could contribute over a meter of sea-level rise by 2100 and more than 15 meters by 2500 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed, with prolonged ocean warming further delaying its recovery for thousands of years. <span class="citation" data-cites="deconto-2016-contribution-antarctica">(<a href="#ref-deconto-2016-contribution-antarctica" role="doc-biblioref">DeConto and Pollard 2016</a>)</span> <code>degree: 114</code> <code>citations: 1045</code><br>

Future scenarios for the impact of climate change on storm surges in the Mediterranean Sea suggest that extreme storm surge magnitudes are projected to range between 0.35 and 0.50 m, with higher values along certain northern coasts and the Gulf of Gabes in the southern part of the sea. While the spatial distribution of surge maxima is expected to remain similar to that of the past, there may be variations in their magnitudes depending on the scenario. Specifically, a decrease of surge maxima from -30% to -2% is anticipated towards the end of the 21st century, although some specific coastal sites in Croatia, Spain, Italy, and France might experience an increase of 1% to 22% under different combinations of regional climate models and representative concentration pathways. The study also identifies correlations between deep depression events and high sea levels in various parts of the Mediterranean, with the strongest connections observed along the northern coasts. However, the influence of deep depressions on storm surges is expected to be lower in southern Mediterranean regions, except for the Gulfs of Gabes and Alexandretta. These findings are based on an analysis of storm surge data from the 20th century and projections towards 2100. <span class="citation" data-cites="makris-2023-impact-climate">(<a href="#ref-makris-2023-impact-climate" role="doc-biblioref">Makris et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 13</code> <code>citations: 1</code><br>
We conducted a study using the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM) to explore the sensitivity of ice sheet models to ocean thermal forcing and basal sliding, and found that the initialization methods of these models can significantly impact future sea level rise predictions, with differences of up to 2 meters over several centuries and up to 0.2 meters by the end of this century. We also identified specific ocean and ice parameter combinations that lead to widespread mass loss within 500 years. Our findings highlight the importance of considering these parameter choices in ice sheet simulations for accurate sea level rise predictions and suggest the inclusion of glacial isostatic adjustment in these simulations. <span class="citation" data-cites="berdahl-2023-exploring-ice">(<a href="#ref-berdahl-2023-exploring-ice" role="doc-biblioref">Berdahl et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 13</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>
This paper introduces a novel framework, called Probabilistic Sea Level Rise Hazard Analysis (PSLRHA), which utilizes current generation models and protocols to project future sea level rise and quantify uncertainties.

Future scenarios based on a business-as-usual CO2 emission scenario until year 4000 AD reveal significant changes in climate, ocean circulation, ecosystems, and biogeochemical cycling, including a 10-degree Celsius increase in global surface air temperature, sea ice melting, collapse of abyssal ocean circulation, decrease in subsurface oxygen concentrations, quadrupling of global water column denitrification, doubling of global ocean primary production, and a significant increase in atmospheric N2O concentrations. The model also suggests that changes in ocean biology become crucial for carbon uptake after year 2600, contributing to 22% of the atmospheric CO2 increase since the preindustrial era by year 4000. <span class="citation" data-cites="schmittner-2008-future-changes">(<a href="#ref-schmittner-2008-future-changes" role="doc-biblioref">Schmittner et al. 2008</a>)</span> <code>degree: 40</code> <code>citations: 285</code><br>

This review examines the interactions and control of photosynthesis and calcification in coral reefs, highlighting the tight coupling between these processes at cellular, organismal, and community levels. The rate of calcification is higher in light than in darkness, contradicting the suggestion that calcification is dark-repressed. However, the ratios of calcification to gross photosynthesis differ between corals and reef communities. The potential impact of global climatic changes on calcification rate is also discussed, with a projected decrease of 10% between 1880 and 1990 and 9-30% (mid estimate: 22%) from 1990 to 2100. The lack of understanding of the calcification mechanism and its interaction with photosynthesis limits accurate predictions of future changes. <span class="citation" data-cites="gattuso-1999-photosynthesis-and">(<a href="#ref-gattuso-1999-photosynthesis-and" role="doc-biblioref">Gattuso, Allemand, and Frankignoulle 1999</a>)</span> <code>degree: 14</code> <code>citations: 600</code><br>

An integrated modeling approach analyzed past trends and four future scenarios of global river nutrient export, revealing that differences in nutrient management in agriculture and sewage treatment significantly impact the magnitude and direction of change in nutrient export, with population changes also playing a crucial role. Regional disparities were observed, with South Asia contributing significantly to the global increase in DIN and DIP river export. <span class="citation" data-cites="seitzinger-2010-global-river">(<a href="#ref-seitzinger-2010-global-river" role="doc-biblioref">Seitzinger et al. 2010</a>)</span> <code>degree: 40</code> <code>citations: 432</code><br>
This study examines the impact of riverine transport of nutrients and carbon on future projections of marine primary production (PP) and carbon (C) uptake using an Earth system model. The inclusion of riverine inputs improves the model’s simulation of contemporary PP and CO2 fluxes, particularly in continental margins and the North Atlantic region. While riverine nutrient inputs mitigate nutrient limitation under future warmer conditions, reducing the projected decline in PP globally, the impact of riverine carbon on projected C uptake depends on the balance between C uptake and CO2 outgassing. The study suggests that increased riverine carbon may have a larger effect on future ocean C uptake than nutrient inputs. However, the results are subject to limitations related to model resolution and process representation, and further research using high-resolution models is recommended to provide more accurate assessments of future riverine scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="gao-2023-riverine-impact">(<a href="#ref-gao-2023-riverine-impact" role="doc-biblioref">S.

Future scenarios for the Black Sea suggest that over half of the rivers will experience increased pollution due to declining population trends, economic development, and urbanization, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the impact of these factors on river pollution; however, implementing advanced wastewater treatment measures could lead to a significant decline in pollution levels by 2100, but this would require coordinated international efforts. <span class="citation" data-cites="strokal-2023-future-the">(<a href="#ref-strokal-2023-future-the" role="doc-biblioref">Strokal, Strokal, and Kroeze 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 5</code> <code>citations: 1</code><br>
This study investigates the impact of climate change on coral reefs, specifically focusing on the role of coral adaptive capacity in preventing the transition of reefs into net erosion. The researchers estimate how the ability of coral symbionts to evolve tolerance to heat stress, or for coral hosts to switch to more favorable symbionts, may influence reef responses to ocean warming and acidification. The results demonstrate that symbiont evolution and shuffling can favor positive net reef calcium carbonate production. However, projections of future net calcium carbonate production vary spatially and by emissions scenarios. While some coral reefs may still have positive net calcium carbonate production by 2050 if symbionts can evolve increased thermal tolerance, the number decreases significantly without symbiont adaptive capacity. Overall, the findings suggest that even with symbiont adaptation, coral reefs globally are likely to transition into erosion by 2050 under severe emissions scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="cornwall-2023-coral-adaptive">(<a href="#ref-cornwall-2023-coral-adaptive" role="doc-biblioref">Cornwall et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 7</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>
Short-term exposure to seasonal temperatures, projected ocean-warming temperatures, and marine heatwaves had little effect on the nutritional quality of eastern school prawns, but longer-term exposure resulted in changes in fatty acid composition and potential increases in certain elements, highlighting the importance of considering duration of exposure when studying nutritional responses in this species.

<p>The common topic in this cluster of texts is the impact of climate change on forest fires. The texts discuss the relationship between climate change and forest fire occurrence, the effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and function, the increase in forest disturbances and their impact on carbon storage, the projected increase in future area burned, the disruptions to global fire activity, the influence of carbon dioxide on plant responses and continental runoff, and the forest fire potential in boreal forests. These texts highlight the significant impact of climate change on forest fire activity, including increased fire occurrence, severity, and damage. Therefore, the common topic can be framed as “The Impact of Climate Change on Forest Fires.”<br>
<strong>Articles:</strong><br>
Climate change is expected to significantly impact forest fire activity in Canada, with projected increases in fire occurrence of 25% by 2030 and 75% by the end of the 21st century according to the Canadian Climate Centre GCM scenarios, and an increase of 140% based on fire climate scenarios derived from the Hadley Centre GCM, indicating that substantial changes to the boreal forest ecosystem are likely unless current climatic trends are altered. <span class="citation" data-cites="wotton-2010-forest-fire">(<a href="#ref-wotton-2010-forest-fire" role="doc-biblioref">Wotton, Nock, and Flannigan 2010</a>)</span> <code>degree: 45</code> <code>citations: 304</code><br>
The response of terrestrial ecosystems to rising CO2 and climate change is explored using six dynamic global vegetation models driven by the IPCC IS92a scenario of rising CO2 and climate changes resulting from effective CO2 concentrations corresponding to IS92a. The simulations reveal a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink during the 1990s, which continues to rise over a century. However, simulations including climate change show a reduced carbon sink due to the impacts of climate change on ecosystems in the tropics and southern hemisphere. Additionally, the rate of increase in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) begins to level off around 2030 due to the diminishing return of physiological CO2 effects at high CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, four out of the six models suggest a decline in NEP after 2050 due to increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical net primary productivity. Changes in vegetation structure also have an impact on the carbon sink and freshwater availability. These findings highlight the need to consider biospheric influences on the carbon balance in future scenarios of atmospheric CO2 and climate change, as well as the uncertainties surrounding the response of NEP to climate change. <span class="citation" data-cites="cramer-2001-global-response">(<a href="#ref-cramer-2001-global-response" role="doc-biblioref">Cramer et al. 2001</a>)</span> <code>degree: 100</code> <code>citations: 1547</code><br>
Increasing forest disturbances in Europe, caused by wind, bark beetles, and wildfires, have been driven by climate change, and are expected to continue to increase in the coming decades, with a projected reduction of 503.4 Tg C in carbon storage potential in Europe’s forests by 2021-2030, emphasizing the need for forest policy and management to prioritize disturbance risk and resilience.

Future area burned in Canada is projected to increase by 74-118% by the end of the century in a 3 x CO2 scenario, according to an analysis of historical weather data, the Canadian fire weather index system, and output from the Canadian and Hadley Centre GCMs; however, there are regional variations in fire activity and the projections do not consider changes in vegetation, ignitions, fire season length, and human activity, which may also impact area burned. <span class="citation" data-cites="flannigan-2005-future-area">(<a href="#ref-flannigan-2005-future-area" role="doc-biblioref">Flannigan et al. 2005</a>)</span> <code>degree: 81</code> <code>citations: 644</code><br>
Future scenarios of climate change and global fire activity disruptions show less pronounced decreases, primarily in tropical and subtropical biomes, with major uncertainties in the direction of near-term changes across over 50% of terrestrial lands, but by the end of the century, there is projected to be a substantial increase in the magnitude and agreement in the direction of change, with most agreement on increasing fire probabilities occurring at mid-to high-latitudes and decreasing probabilities mainly in the tropics; however, further research is needed to assess the explanatory power of interannual variation in climate variables in capturing fire probability patterns and to evaluate fire-related vulnerabilities to humans and ecosystems. <span class="citation" data-cites="moritz-NA-climate-change">(<a href="#ref-moritz-NA-climate-change" role="doc-biblioref">Moritz et al. 1800</a>)</span> <code>degree: 61</code> <code>citations: NA</code><br>
The projected increase in continental runoff due to plant responses to increasing carbon dioxide concentration, also known as physiological forcing, has been detected in observational records of increasing average continental runoff over the twentieth century. Using a global climate model with a vegetation component, we find that the physiological effect of doubled carbon dioxide concentrations on plant transpiration leads to a 6% increase in simulated global mean runoff relative to pre-industrial levels, considering uncertainties in future precipitation. <span class="citation" data-cites="betts-2007-projected-increase">(<a href="#ref-betts-2007-projected-increase" role="doc-biblioref">Betts et al. 2007</a>)</span> <code>degree: 19</code> <code>citations: 504</code><br>

<p>The common topic of the cluster is the impact of climate change on air quality, specifically regarding tropospheric ozone and aerosols. The texts discuss how climate change affects the concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter in the atmosphere, both globally and regionally, and how these changes are influenced by greenhouse gas emissions. They highlight the complex interactions between climate change, emissions, and meteorological factors, and emphasize the need to consider climate-induced changes when planning for future air quality standards. The cluster provides insights into the predicted increase in surface layer ozone concentrations, the role of regional climate change and emissions in air pollution, and the potential implications for human health and the environment. Therefore, the common topic of the cluster is “Climate Change and Air Quality.”<br>
<strong>Articles:</strong><br>
Climate change is expected to have complex effects on future tropospheric ozone and aerosol levels, with reductions in global ozone burden but increased surface layer ozone concentrations over populated and biomass burning areas, as well as changes in aerosol burdens due to altered emissions and thermodynamic equilibrium. <span class="citation" data-cites="liao-2006-role-climate">(<a href="#ref-liao-2006-role-climate" role="doc-biblioref">Liao, Chen, and Seinfeld 2006</a>)</span> <code>degree: 64</code> <code>citations: 198</code><br>
Future scenarios of regional air pollution over the eastern United States were simulated using a modeling system that incorporated climate change, emissions, and atmospheric composition.

Future scenarios of global climate change and emissions reveal a potential decrease in regional ozone and fine particulate matter concentrations over the United States, with reductions of more than 50% in NOX and SO2 emissions, leading to a 20% decrease in mean summer maximum daily 8-hour ozone levels and an estimated 23% lower mean annual PM2.5 concentrations, particularly benefiting the eastern United States and urban sites like Atlanta. <span class="citation" data-cites="tagaris-2007-impacts-global">(<a href="#ref-tagaris-2007-impacts-global" role="doc-biblioref">Tagaris et al. 2007</a>)</span> <code>degree: 59</code> <code>citations: 155</code><br>
Future scenarios of climate change in the United States are predicted to result in a decrease in background ozone levels, but an increase in ozone produced internally, particularly in the eastern region, leading to up to 12 additional days per year exceeding the maximum daily 8-hour averaged ozone limit of 80 ppbv. Various climatic factors, such as temperature, water vapor, clouds, transport, and lightning NOx, are identified as influencing the net increase in ozone. <span class="citation" data-cites="murazaki-2006-how-does">(<a href="#ref-murazaki-2006-how-does" role="doc-biblioref">Murazaki and Hess 2006</a>)</span> <code>degree: 64</code> <code>citations: 156</code><br>
We present greenhouse gas concentrations for the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and their extensions beyond 2100, known as the Extended Concentration Pathways (ECPs), which include major anthropogenic greenhouse gases and are the result of a multi-year effort to produce new scenarios for climate change research. The projected global-mean surface temperature increases range from 1.5 degrees C by 2100 for the lowest RCP (RCP2.6) to 4.5 degrees C for the highest one (RCP8.5), relative to pre-industrial levels. We also provide the GHG concentrations for supplementary extensions, illustrating the emissions implications of different scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="meinshausen-2011-rcp-greenhouse">(<a href="#ref-meinshausen-2011-rcp-greenhouse" role="doc-biblioref">Meinshausen et al. 2011</a>)</span> <code>degree: 94</code> <code>citations: 2444</code><br>
Observational and reanalysis data have shown a significant trend towards the positive phase of the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM), indicating a major shift in the broadscale climate of the Southern Hemisphere; however, previous studies using NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data have been compromised by spurious negative trends and errors in SH high-latitude pressure, highlighting the need for a reliable benchmark against which future climate scenarios can be evaluated; this study addresses this issue by employing an empirical definition of the SAM and station data, revealing a statistically significant increase in the difference in zonal mean sea level pressure between 40°S and 65°S, with the trend being most pronounced since the mid-1970s; however, it is also shown that trends in the SAM and zonal mean sea level pressure difference are exaggerated in the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data, while equivalent data from the ECMWF ERA-40 reanalysis provides a more accurate representation of SH high-latitude atmospheric circulation variability, making it ideal for examining the recent trend in the SAM.

A comprehensive evaluation of nitrogen and sulfur deposition across the globe reveals that models generally agree with observations in Europe and North America, but overestimate NHx deposition in South Asia and underestimate NOy deposition in East Asia. Variability in removal mechanisms leads to significant differences in deposition fluxes, particularly in anthropogenic emission regions. Currently, a substantial percentage of deposition occurs over the ocean, while natural vegetation receives the majority of land-based deposition. Approximately 11% of global natural vegetation exceeds the critical load threshold for nitrogen deposition. Future deposition fluxes will be primarily driven by changes in emissions, with Europe and Asia being the most affected regions. <span class="citation" data-cites="dentener-2006-nitrogen-and">(<a href="#ref-dentener-2006-nitrogen-and" role="doc-biblioref">Dentener et al. 2006</a>)</span> <code>degree: 29</code> <code>citations: 762</code><br>
Future scenarios of substantial short- and long-term health effects due to PM2.5 and its constituents in China are explored, showing that even with emission reductions, premature deaths are projected to increase due to aging offsetting air quality improvements, with organic carbon identified as the major contributor to short-term exposure deaths and compound events of high relative humidity and atmospheric stagnation found to have a larger impact on premature deaths compared to individual events, emphasizing the importance of considering both long- and short-term health effects and extreme weather events. <span class="citation" data-cites="xiang-2023-substantial-short">(<a href="#ref-xiang-2023-substantial-short" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>xiang-2023-substantial-short?</strong></a>-)</span> <code>degree: 8</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>
Future scenarios of ozone-related mortality in China over the period 2013-2030 show that changes in ozone concentration, population age structure, population size, and mortality rate for respiratory disease will contribute to varying rates of O3-mortality; while the deterioration of ozone air quality is identified as the primary factor contributing to the rise in O3-mortality from 2013-2019, population aging alone is projected to result in significant increases in O3-mortality in the coming decade, surpassing the impact of ozone air quality deterioration. <span class="citation" data-cites="chen-2023-increases-ozone-related">(<a href="#ref-chen-2023-increases-ozone-related" role="doc-biblioref">L.

This study explores the impacts of technology-driven climate and emission changes on future meteorology and air quality in the U.S. Using a Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry simulations, two climate scenarios (A1B and B2) and emissions from a Technology Driver Model are integrated. The results show widespread reductions in gas and aerosol species emissions, but an increase in maximum daily average 8-hour ozone levels due to temperature increases and methane concentrations. However, under the B2 scenario, ozone levels decrease except near urban centers. The study also finds that both climate and emission changes lead to decreases in daily average PM2.5 concentrations, particularly in the eastern U.S., suggesting potential improvements in future air quality.

Simulated future air quality scenarios in Korea, based on different emission control pathways, indicate reductions in NO2, SO2, and PM2.5 concentrations, as well as a decrease in O3 levels under SSP1 (most sustainable pathway) in the long-term. However, under SSP3 (most challenging pathway), O3 concentrations increase due to elevated CH4 levels and biogenic VOC emissions. While overall PM2.5 concentrations decrease, the contribution of biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) to PM2.5 is projected to increase. Estimating cardiorespiratory mortality changes, we find that the total excess mortality due to air pollutants decreases under SSP1 but increases by 80% in 2045 and decreases by 22% in 2095 under SSP3, highlighting the significant health implications of different emission scenarios. Additionally, the regional variability of BSOA contribution emphasizes the potential local health impact of BSOA in the future. <span class="citation" data-cites="oak-2023-future-air">(<a href="#ref-oak-2023-future-air" role="doc-biblioref">Oak et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 10</code> <code>citations: 0</code></p>

This study examines future climate projections of climate extremes indices using the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, finding that changes in indices based on daily minimum temperatures are more pronounced than those based on daily maximum temperatures, and that extreme precipitation generally increases faster than total wet-day precipitation. Changes in temperature and precipitation indices are most significant under RCP8.5, exceeding previous studies based on SRES scenarios. The complete set of indices is available for further research.

This study evaluates temperature and precipitation extremes in global climate models participating in the IPCC diagnostic exercise for the Fourth Assessment Report. The models simulate present-day warm extremes well, but struggle with cold extremes, particularly in sea ice-covered areas. Precipitation extremes are plausible in the extratropics, but uncertainties remain in the Tropics. Changes in warm extremes follow mean summertime temperature changes, with cold extremes warming faster. The intensity of precipitation extremes generally exceeds changes in mean precipitation, leading to reduced waiting times for extreme events. The consensus among models is that 20-year return values of annual extremes of 24-hour precipitation amounts will increase by about 6% with each kelvin of global warming. However, large intermodel disagreements in the Tropics reduce confidence in these projections. <span class="citation" data-cites="kharin-2007-changes-temperature">(<a href="#ref-kharin-2007-changes-temperature" role="doc-biblioref">Kharin et al. 2007</a>)</span> <code>degree: 63</code> <code>citations: 792</code><br>
This study evaluates changes in temperature and precipitation extremes in an ensemble of climate models participating in the CMIP5 project, documenting projected changes for three radiative forcing scenarios. The models perform comparably to the CMIP3 ensemble in simulating 20-year temperature and precipitation extremes, with better agreement for warm extremes. However, uncertainties remain in simulating extreme precipitation in the tropics and subtropics. Cold extremes warm faster than warm extremes, particularly in regions affected by snow and sea-ice retreat. Intensity of precipitation extremes generally increases more than annual mean precipitation, resulting in reduced waiting times for extreme events. The CMIP5 planetary sensitivity in extreme precipitation is approximately 6% per degree Celsius, with lower values over extratropical land. <span class="citation" data-cites="kharin-2013-changes-temperature">(<a href="#ref-kharin-2013-changes-temperature" role="doc-biblioref">Kharin et al. 2013</a>)</span> <code>degree: 67</code> <code>citations: 757</code><br>
Future climate change over East Asia, as assessed using the RCP scenarios downscaled by GRIMs-RMP, indicates strong warming coupled with intensified monsoonal precipitation, with extreme weather conditions projected to increase and intensify over South Korea, including a significant increase in the frequency of heat wave events and an increase in the frequency and variability of heavy rainfall. <span class="citation" data-cites="lee-2014-assessment-future">(<a href="#ref-lee-2014-assessment-future" role="doc-biblioref">Lee et al. 2014</a>)</span> <code>degree: 79</code> <code>citations: 373</code><br>
Investigating the nonstationary association of monsoon temperature and precipitation extremes in East-Central India, this study finds that the nonstationarity of precipitation extremes is becoming more pronounced under anthropogenic warming. The generalized extreme value distribution is used to model the trend in parameters of the distribution, with local temperature categories as covariates. The results show significant trends in precipitation frequency and intensity over certain regions, with high uncertainty in estimated quantiles over the Himalayan territory. The study also predicts average design return values for different return periods in various regions. <span class="citation" data-cites="biswas-2023-investigation-nonstationary">(<a href="#ref-biswas-2023-investigation-nonstationary" role="doc-biblioref">Biswas and Bhattacharya 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 11</code> <code>citations: 1</code><br>
This study investigates future scenarios of drying in subtropical East Asia during winter and identifies the mechanism behind it. It finds that the weakening of the southern branch westerly jet on the southern side of the Tibetan Plateau plays a crucial role in suppressing precipitation in the region. The study also highlights that the models underestimate the sensitivity of precipitation to interannual variability in the jet stream. By considering observational constraints, the projected drying trend is amplified, showing a decrease in precipitation of 3.3% per degree of warming, with greater reductions in southern China. <span class="citation" data-cites="he-2023-future-drying">(<a href="#ref-he-2023-future-drying" role="doc-biblioref">He 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 12</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>
Future scenarios indicate that the northern boundary of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is projected to shift northwestward by 70-170 km during 2080-2099 compared to 1981-2010, due to the strengthened EASM resulting from increased land-sea thermal contrast and atmospheric water vapor content in response to global warming, potentially mitigating drought conditions in northern arid regions of eastern China. <span class="citation" data-cites="wu-2023-northwestward-advance">(<a href="#ref-wu-2023-northwestward-advance" role="doc-biblioref">BL.

The study used high-resolution simulations of the regional climate model RegCM4.7 to assess the projected changes in tropical South America under different emissions scenarios. The model showed added value in reproducing historical climate patterns in certain regions but had limitations in representing precipitation over the Amazon Basin. However, the more refined simulation of RegCM4.7 improved the projected change patterns compared to the coarser resolution simulation of HadGEM2-ES. Both models projected increased temperatures, with greater magnitude under the high emissions scenario. <span class="citation" data-cites="da-2023-dynamic-downscaling">(<a href="#ref-da-2023-dynamic-downscaling" role="doc-biblioref">Da Silva et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 15</code> <code>citations: 0</code></p>

Three scenarios of future mortality and disability were developed, considering factors such as socioeconomic development, educational attainment, technological advancements, and exposure to hazards. Projections were made for different age-sex groups, causes, and regions using regression equations based on GDP, education, time, and smoking intensity. The study also projected years of life lived with disability (YLDs) based on projected numbers of deaths and relation models of YLDs to years of life lost (YLLs). The findings indicated an increase in life expectancy at birth for women in all three scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="murray-1997-alternative-projections">(<a href="#ref-murray-1997-alternative-projections" role="doc-biblioref">Murray and Lopez 1997</a>)</span> <code>degree: 10</code> <code>citations: 4964</code><br>
Increasing temperature variability, in addition to rising mean temperatures, may explain the record-breaking central European summer temperatures in 2003, which cannot be accounted for by the current understanding of heatwave occurrence; simulations of future European climate with increased greenhouse gas concentrations show temperature variability increasing by up to 100%. <span class="citation" data-cites="schar-2004-role-increasing">(<a href="#ref-schar-2004-role-increasing" role="doc-biblioref">Schar et al. 2004</a>)</span> <code>degree: 57</code> <code>citations: 2081</code><br>
This multicountry observational study quantified the mortality burden associated with non-optimum ambient temperature and assessed the relative contributions of heat and cold, as well as moderate and extreme temperatures. The findings revealed that cold temperatures were responsible for a larger proportion of temperature-related deaths compared to heat, and that milder but non-optimum weather had a greater impact than extreme temperatures. These results have important implications for public-health interventions and predictions of future effects in climate-change scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="gasparrini-NA-mortality-risk">(<a href="#ref-gasparrini-NA-mortality-risk" role="doc-biblioref">Gasparrini et al. 1800</a>)</span> <code>degree: 52</code> <code>citations: NA</code><br>
Land-atmosphere interactions play a crucial role in increasing summer temperature variability in central and eastern Europe, as predicted by climate models, due to the shifting of climatic regimes northwards in response to rising greenhouse gas concentrations, creating a new transitional climate zone in this region. These findings underscore the significance of soil-moisture-temperature feedbacks in influencing summer climate variability and the potential migration of climate zones with strong land-atmosphere coupling as a result of global warming. <span class="citation" data-cites="seneviratne-2006-land-atmosphere-coupling">(<a href="#ref-seneviratne-2006-land-atmosphere-coupling" role="doc-biblioref">Seneviratne et al. 2006</a>)</span> <code>degree: 17</code> <code>citations: 1127</code><br>
Future scenarios for diabetes burden in the US adult population by 2050 are projected to show an increase in annual diagnosed diabetes incidence, with total diabetes prevalence projected to reach 21% to 33% of the population, depending on incidence rates and mortality.

Relaxing current restrictions on nicotine vaping products in Australia could lead to significant public health gains, according to a modeling study. The study found that under a permissive scenario, assuming an NVP excess risk of 5% that of smoking, over 100 thousand smoking-attributable deaths and 2 million life years lost could be averted between 2017 and 2080. The impact is most sensitive to the rate at which smokers switch to vaping and quit smoking. However, more research is needed to better understand the impact of NVPs on smoking if access regulations were relaxed. The study highlights the potential benefits of maintaining cigarette-oriented policies while relaxing current NVP restrictions in Australia. <span class="citation" data-cites="levy-2023-australia-smoking">(<a href="#ref-levy-2023-australia-smoking" role="doc-biblioref">Levy et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 2</code> <code>citations: 2</code><br>

This study investigated public willingness to pay for heat-resilient infrastructure in Guangzhou, China, and found that over 90% of respondents expected government involvement in payment, with around 42.3% supporting payment directly. The average payment amount was estimated to be between 19.9 and 27.6 Yuan, depending on different scenarios. Heat-related impacts on sleep/rest and heat adaptation awareness positively influenced payment willingness, while experience of heat-related psychological illness and heat adaptation awareness positively influenced payment amount. These findings contribute to understanding heat-related payment issues and inform economic support for heat mitigation and adaptation. <span class="citation" data-cites="liu-2023-identification-factors">(<a href="#ref-liu-2023-identification-factors" role="doc-biblioref">X.

<p>The common topic of the cluster is the impact of climate change on building energy consumption and the need for energy efficiency policies. The articles discuss the current and future trends in building energy consumption, the comparison of energy consumption among different countries, and the potential effects of climate change on heating and cooling energy requirements in buildings. They highlight the urgency of promoting building energy efficiency policies, the insufficiency of current policies in reducing energy consumption, and the need for adopting cost-effective practices and technologies to mitigate the forecasted increase in energy demand. Overall, the cluster focuses on the importance of addressing climate change and implementing sustainable practices in the building sector to reduce energy consumption and mitigate its environmental impact.<br>

This paper presents a cross-country comparison of building energy consumption, focusing on US, EU, and BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), and discusses historical, current, and future trends. The study finds that building energy consumption in BRIC countries has surpassed that of developed countries, highlighting the need for energy efficiency policies. Additionally, current policies in developed countries are inadequate to significantly reduce energy consumption in buildings. The paper concludes that the global energy demand in buildings will double by 2050 unless cost-effective practices, technologies, and behavioral changes are adopted globally.

This study examined the potential impact of climate change on heating and cooling energy requirements for residential houses in various regional climates in Australia. The findings suggest that climate change could significantly affect energy requirements, with projected variations ranging from -26% to 101% by 2050 and -48% to 350% by 2100, depending on the emission scenarios and existing regional climate. The study also highlights that houses in temperate climates, such as Sydney, are particularly sensitive to climate change, potentially straining local energy supply. Energy-efficient houses may experience less absolute changes in energy requirements but higher percentage changes. These findings underscore the need to consider the effects of global warming when planning energy requirements for energy-efficient buildings.

This analysis investigates the impact of future climate scenarios on the energy use of commercial buildings in the United States, using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios defined in the IPCC Assessment Report 5. The study finds that, if US commercial floorspace remained constant, total energy use by 2100 is predicted to decrease by 1.75% under the highest emission scenario (8.5) and increase by 1.76% under the lowest emission scenario (2.6). Adjusted for anticipated urban growth, the predicted range is a 65% increase (8.5) to a 71% increase (2.6). Furthermore, the warmest climate zones in the US will experience significant increases in electricity use for cooling, while the coldest climate zones will see decreases in natural gas use for heating. Ultimately, climate change is projected to be a net energy saver for the United States from a building energy perspective. <span class="citation" data-cites="bass-2023-how-will">(<a href="#ref-bass-2023-how-will" role="doc-biblioref">Bass and New 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 11</code> <code>citations: 2</code><br>
This study focuses on improving the assessment of the operational phase of buildings in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies by considering variations in operational energy use due to climate change. Using a dynamic assessment method, the study assesses a Belgian office building and finds that a climate change scenario leads to a decrease in gas use for heating and an increase in electricity use for cooling and ventilation. The environmental impact of the building depends on the electricity mix, with changes ranging from a 13% reduction to a 10% increase in global warming potential. However, when considering a broader set of environmental indicators, the overall environmental impact may only decrease by 4% or even increase by 7% compared to the current electricity mix.

This study presents a novel approach for sizing and designing cooling and heating systems in nearly zero-energy office buildings in Brussels, considering the long-term effects of climate change. Using climate data from a regional atmospheric model, the study evaluates the performance of different HVAC strategies and quantifies the impact on overheating, cooling energy use, overcooling, and heating energy use. The results show an increase in overheating and cooling energy use, as well as a decrease in overcooling and heating energy use, by the end of the century. However, the study demonstrates that with climate change sensitive sizing and design, coupled with optimal sizing, the reference building can be resistant to climate change effects. The paper concludes with recommendations for future practice and research. <span class="citation" data-cites="amaripadath-2023-climate-change">(<a href="#ref-amaripadath-2023-climate-change" role="doc-biblioref">Amaripadath et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 9</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>
Climate change impacts on the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of cross-laminated timber (CLT) and reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in China are assessed using future weather data. Results show that heating demands will decrease while cooling demands will increase due to global warming.

This paper investigated the calibration of trust in automated driving, specifically focusing on the effect of time, personality traits, and system warning design. Through two driving simulator experiments, the study found that trust in automation initially increased during short-term interactions but decreased after four months, although it remained higher than pre-experiment trust. Initial trust and trust propensity had a consistent impact on trust, while drivers trusted the system more with a two-stage warning design compared to a one-stage design. The results contribute to understanding trust calibration in long-term human-automation interactions and can inform the design of more effective automated driving systems. <span class="citation" data-cites="qu-2023-understanding-trust">(<a href="#ref-qu-2023-understanding-trust" role="doc-biblioref">Qu et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 5</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>
This paper explores the impact of different pick-up and drop-off (PUDO) locations and densities on the operations of a shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) fleet in Austin, Texas.

<p>The common topic across the texts in this cluster is the impact of environmental factors, such as nitrogen addition, increased precipitation, warming, and drought, on plant and soil ecosystems. These studies investigate the responses of plant communities, microbial communities, soil respiration, and soil organic carbon to these environmental changes. The findings highlight the importance of water availability, species traits, soil acidity, and nutrient availability in shaping plant and soil communities under changing environmental conditions. The studies also emphasize the need to consider the differential responses of ecosystem components and the functionality of the soil organic carbon pool when predicting the effects of future climate change. Therefore, the common topic of this cluster is the effects of environmental changes on plant and soil ecosystems.<br>

Increased nitrogen (N) enrichment and precipitation are expected to impact plant communities, influencing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A study in a temperate steppe in northern China found that increased precipitation and N addition had contrasting effects on species richness. Plant community structure and composition were significantly altered by these treatments, with soil moisture and species traits playing important roles. Understanding these factors will be crucial for predicting vegetation dynamics in response to future environmental changes. <span class="citation" data-cites="yang-2011-plant-community">(<a href="#ref-yang-2011-plant-community" role="doc-biblioref">HJ.

Future scenarios of warming and drought in grassland ecosystems are likely to have significant effects on microbial communities, including changes in population size, diversity, and composition, with warming treatments generally increasing population size and decreasing diversity, but drought conditions leading to a reduction in population size and changes in species richness, diversity, and evenness. <span class="citation" data-cites="sheik-2011-effect-warming">(<a href="#ref-sheik-2011-effect-warming" role="doc-biblioref">Sheik et al. 2011</a>)</span> <code>degree: 6</code> <code>citations: 246</code><br>
Soil acidification plays a larger role in controlling soil respiration than soil nitrogen availability in grasslands that are subjected to long-term nitrogen enrichment, highlighting the need to consider N-induced soil acidification when predicting the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in future scenarios of nitrogen deposition. <span class="citation" data-cites="chen-2016-soil-acidification">(<a href="#ref-chen-2016-soil-acidification" role="doc-biblioref">DM.

Warming significantly increased above-ground plant respiration and total autotrophic plant respiration, but reduced heterotrophic respiration in a meadow grassland on the Tibetan Plateau, resulting in insensitive responses of ecosystem respiration and soil respiration to warming. These findings suggest that future carbon-climate feedbacks should consider the differential responses of ecosystem respiration components under warming scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="chen-2016-differential-responses">(<a href="#ref-chen-2016-differential-responses" role="doc-biblioref">J.

Nitrogen enrichment increases particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) pools in soil, but decreases the ratios of MAOC to SOC and MAOC to POC. Increases in POC are correlated with aboveground plant biomass and hydrolytic enzymes, while increases in MAOC are linked to microbial biomass. These findings suggest that while nitrogen deposition can enhance soil carbon sequestration, it may also reduce nutrient density, turnover time, and resistance to disturbance in the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool.

Recent advancements have led to the development of a comprehensive stratigraphic framework, which incorporates onshore and offshore data, and allows for testing through deep drilling. This ecological crisis, driven by geodynamic and climatic factors, had a profound impact on the Mediterranean’s geological history and global ocean salinity. The MSC unfolded in three distinct stages, each marked by unique palaeoenvironmental conditions. <span class="citation" data-cites="roveri-2014-messinian-salinity">(<a href="#ref-roveri-2014-messinian-salinity" role="doc-biblioref">Roveri et al. 2014</a>)</span> <code>degree: 3</code> <code>citations: 384</code><br>
This meta-analysis examines the effects of nitrogen fertilization on soil extracellular enzyme activities and carbon and nitrogen storage. The study finds that nitrogen fertilization increases certain enzyme activities but decreases others, and also has differential effects on soil carbon, nitrogen, and microbial biomass. The authors suggest that the observed relationship between enzyme activities and microbial biomass could be used as a proxy for carbon acquisition in future models of global nitrogen enrichment scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="jian-2016-soil-extracellular">(<a href="#ref-jian-2016-soil-extracellular" role="doc-biblioref">Jian et al. 2016</a>)</span> <code>degree: 2</code> <code>citations: 396</code><br>

Future scenarios of more extreme and frequent drought events in semiarid grasslands may lead to large reductions in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and perennial forb biomass, but our study found that ANPP fully recovered within 1 year after the drought treatments were terminated, primarily due to increased soil total nitrogen and root biomass allocation after drought. Surprisingly, the extreme drought treatment led to overcompensation, with large increases in ANPP during the recovery periods compared to the control, driven by the enhanced biomass of perennial grasses. This highlights the rapid recovery of grasslands and the critical role of community overcompensation in maintaining ecosystem function and stability under future climate change scenarios. <span class="citation" data-cites="ru-2023-overcompensation-ecosystem">(<a href="#ref-ru-2023-overcompensation-ecosystem" role="doc-biblioref">Ru et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 2</code> <code>citations: 1</code><br>
Moderate precipitation reduction in a semi-arid grassland enhances plant root turnover and soil nitrogen (N)-cycling processes, leading to increased emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) after each rainfall event, primarily through nitrification processes, according to field experiments and lab incubation studies. These findings suggest that future precipitation scenarios with altered drying-rewetting cycles may intensify N cycling and soil N2O emissions in semi-arid ecosystems, contributing to climate change. <span class="citation" data-cites="zhang-2023-moderate-precipitation">(<a href="#ref-zhang-2023-moderate-precipitation" role="doc-biblioref">KC.

Soil degradation and land scarcity present a complex challenge to food security, as they reduce yield and may lead to soil abandonment; yet, the importance of preserving soil health is often overlooked by policy makers. In this paper, we review the typologies and global estimates of soil degradation, discuss the interwoven issues of agricultural production, natural resources, and land use, and analyze scenarios for the availability of arable land. We argue for a precautionary approach given the uncertainties and risks involved, and emphasize the need for sustainable agricultural practices and a reconsideration of our relationship with nature and resources. <span class="citation" data-cites="gomiero-2016-soil-degradation">(<a href="#ref-gomiero-2016-soil-degradation" role="doc-biblioref">Gomiero 2016</a>)</span> <code>degree: 2</code> <code>citations: 209</code><br>
This study addresses the limitations in previous soil erosion models by considering both direct impacts of climate change, such as increased rainfall intensity, and indirect impacts, such as changes in land use and management. The results show that future climate change has the potential to increase soil erosion, highlighting the need to incorporate these factors in future conservation strategies.

The study proposes a methodology for estimating the cover-management factor (C-factor) in the European Union (EU) using pan-European datasets, biophysical attributes derived from remote sensing, and statistical data on agricultural crops and practices, finding a mean C-factor of 0.1043 with high variability. <span class="citation" data-cites="panagos-2015-estimating-soil">(<a href="#ref-panagos-2015-estimating-soil" role="doc-biblioref">Panagos et al. 2015</a>)</span> <code>degree: 20</code> <code>citations: 382</code><br>
Future scenarios of land use and climate change are predicted to either decrease or increase global soil erosion by water by 2070, depending on socioeconomic developments impacting land use, with climate projections indicating a trend towards a more vigorous hydrological cycle that could increase global water erosion; these findings aim to inform efforts to assess global soil erosion and develop national strategies for soil conservation. <span class="citation" data-cites="borrelli-2020-land-use">(<a href="#ref-borrelli-2020-land-use" role="doc-biblioref">Borrelli et al. 2020</a>)</span> <code>degree: 27</code> <code>citations: 333</code><br>
This study examines the future scenarios of soil erosion in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area in China, taking into account both global climate change and regional vegetation restoration projects. The results suggest that while overall soil erosion is projected to decrease, different calculation methods for erosion factors can lead to different trends, with some indicating a significant increase in erosion. The study also highlights the effectiveness of the grain-for-green policy in reducing soil erosion, particularly in scenarios with higher forest cover. Additionally, the increasing precipitation in all scenarios emphasizes the need for continued efforts to control soil loss in the TGR area. <span class="citation" data-cites="luo-2023-spatiotemporal-foresting">(<a href="#ref-luo-2023-spatiotemporal-foresting" role="doc-biblioref">ZB.

Future climate change scenarios in a semi-arid region of the Mediterranean, specifically the High Atlas of Morocco, were examined to assess the potential impact on soil erosion rates. High-resolution precipitation and temperature data from regional climate model simulations were collected for the baseline period (1976-2005) and future periods (2030-2060 and 2061-2090). The results indicate a projected decrease in annual precipitation and an increase in temperature, which are expected to significantly increase the soil erosion potential rate in the region. <span class="citation" data-cites="elaloui-2023-soil-erosion">(<a href="#ref-elaloui-2023-soil-erosion" role="doc-biblioref">Elaloui et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 5</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>
This study investigates the future scenarios of soil erosion by water in Europe by 2050, considering the impact of climate change, land use patterns, socio-economic development, and agro-environmental policies. Using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) adjusted at a continental scale, the researchers project a potential increase of 13% to 22.5% in the mean soil erosion rate in the European Union and the UK compared to the current baseline. The study suggests that a combination of targeted cover crops and limited soil disturbance measures can partially or completely mitigate the effects of climate change on soil losses, emphasizing the need for effective soil conservation policies on agricultural lands with erosion rates above 5 t ha(-1) yr(-1). <span class="citation" data-cites="panagos-2021-projections-soil">(<a href="#ref-panagos-2021-projections-soil" role="doc-biblioref">Panagos et al. 2021</a>)</span> <code>degree: 26</code> <code>citations: 51</code></p>

<p>The common topic of the cluster is the cognitive processes involved in mental time travel, episodic memory, and future thinking. The articles discuss the mechanisms and neural substrates that allow humans to mentally travel in time, simulate future scenarios, and imagine hypothetical events. They explore how these cognitive processes are linked to memory, decision-making, risk-taking behavior, and entrepreneurial thinking. The cluster highlights the importance of cognitive flexibility and the ability to consider future outcomes in shaping human behavior. Therefore, the common topic can be framed as “The Cognitive Processes and Neural Mechanisms of Mental Time Travel and Future Thinking.”<br>

This article discusses the mechanisms of mental time travel, which allows humans to envision potential future scenarios and make decisions accordingly. The authors propose the use of future-oriented action methodologies to study mental time travel in children, as linguistic performance alone may be misleading. They also suggest an experimental paradigm to assess mental time travel in nonhuman animals, and describe a preliminary study using this paradigm for children.

The cognitive neuroscience of constructive memory focuses on the idea that memory is a constructive process prone to errors and illusions, and recent studies suggest that memory distortions serve adaptive functions. One key function is the ability to simulate or imagine future scenarios by drawing on past experiences, as evidenced by overlapping psychological and neural processes involved in remembering the past and imagining the future. <span class="citation" data-cites="schacter-2007-cognitive-neuroscience">(<a href="#ref-schacter-2007-cognitive-neuroscience" role="doc-biblioref">Schacter and Addis 2007</a>)</span> <code>degree: 51</code> <code>citations: 1052</code><br>
This study found that people tend to underestimate their own task completion times, but not others’, and that they focus on future scenarios rather than past experiences when making predictions. Participants’ predictions were overly optimistic, but when instructed to consider relevant past experiences, this bias was eliminated. Additionally, participants attributed their past prediction failures to external, transient, and specific factors. Observer participants, on the other hand, overestimated others’ completion times and relied more on past experiences. <span class="citation" data-cites="buehler-1994-exploring-planning">(<a href="#ref-buehler-1994-exploring-planning" role="doc-biblioref">BUEHLER, GRIFFIN, and ROSS 1994</a>)</span> <code>degree: 11</code> <code>citations: 592</code><br>

Using cognitive theory to explain entrepreneurial risk-taking, this study found that entrepreneurs categorize equivocal business scenarios more positively than non-entrepreneurs, leading them to view these situations as opportunities rather than risky ventures with low returns. This suggests that cognitive processes, unlike personal traits, can be changed, offering hope for identifying and exploiting business opportunities and potentially developing a taxonomy to differentiate entrepreneurs from small business owners. <span class="citation" data-cites="palich-1995-using-cognitive">(<a href="#ref-palich-1995-using-cognitive" role="doc-biblioref">PALICH and BAGBY 1995</a>)</span> <code>degree: 2</code> <code>citations: 496</code><br>
This article explores the concept of episodic future thought, which involves mentally simulating hypothetical scenarios that may occur in the future. It discusses the relationship between episodic future thought and the ability to remember personal episodes from one’s past, and suggests that both episodic and semantic memory contribute to the construction of episodic future thoughts. The role of abstracted representations in this process is also discussed. <span class="citation" data-cites="szpunar-2010-episodic-future">(<a href="#ref-szpunar-2010-episodic-future" role="doc-biblioref">Szpunar 2010</a>)</span> <code>degree: 27</code> <code>citations: 438</code><br>
Age-related decline in episodic specificity of past events has been well-documented, but it remains unclear if this decline also applies to the simulation of future events. In a study using an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview, older adults were found to generate fewer internal details (episodic) than younger adults when generating both past and future events, replicating previous findings on age-related changes in episodic memory. <span class="citation" data-cites="addis-2008-age-related-changes">(<a href="#ref-addis-2008-age-related-changes" role="doc-biblioref">Addis, Wong, and Schacter 2008</a>)</span> <code>degree: 26</code> <code>citations: 432</code><br>
A randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the effectiveness of an online cognitive-bias-modification program in training individuals to have more positive episodic predictions. The results showed that participants in the positive-training condition demonstrated improvements in negative and positive expectancy bias, as well as self-efficacy. These gains were maintained at a 1-month follow-up. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in anxiety and depression symptoms or growth mindset between the different conditions. This study highlights the potential of scalable programs to target and improve cognitive biases and outlook. <span class="citation" data-cites="eberle-2023-shifting-episodic">(<a href="#ref-eberle-2023-shifting-episodic" role="doc-biblioref">Eberle et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 1</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>

In this study, the researchers investigated the relationship between mental imagery content and disease severity in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). They found that the quality of visual imagery (VI) content during daily practice was related to functional connectivity changes in brain areas supporting visuospatial and sensorimotor processes. Additionally, subjects with worse disease severity showed poorer quality of VI content. These findings suggest that mental imagery training combining VI and motor imagery (MI) may enhance motor function in patients with mild PD, highlighting the importance of incorporating self-reports of thoughts and experiences in neuroimaging studies of complex cognitive processes in neuropsychiatric patient populations. <span class="citation" data-cites="cherry-2023-mental-imagery">(<a href="#ref-cherry-2023-mental-imagery" role="doc-biblioref">Cherry et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 2</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>
Verbal explanations and item choices in children’s episodic foresight tasks were examined to determine the extent to which future projection, memory, or semantic associations are required for success. Results showed that children’s explanations were more future-oriented and included more personal pronouns in the Picture-book task compared to the Spoon task, indicating a higher level of future orientation and self-projection. Age and item choice were significant predictors of future orientation and episodicity in the Picture-book task, while item choice significantly predicted future orientation and episodicity in the Spoon task. This study demonstrates the importance of verbal explanations in understanding the underlying processes of episodic foresight. <span class="citation" data-cites="mazachowsky-2023-verbal-explanations">(<a href="#ref-mazachowsky-2023-verbal-explanations" role="doc-biblioref">Mazachowsky et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 3</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>
This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and other representation methods in projecting oneself into a future office space and its influence on willingness to relocate. Participants were assigned to different representation conditions (VR, desktop, and paper) and were instructed to freely explore their representation method. The results indicate that VR significantly differed in terms of presence, user experience, and engagement compared to other methods. Users in VR spent more time exploring the environment and provided more positive comments about the building. Overall, VR enhanced users’ capability to imagine future scenarios, supported them in projecting themselves into these spaces, and positively affected their attitude towards relocating. <span class="citation" data-cites="weerasinghe-2023-exploring-future">(<a href="#ref-weerasinghe-2023-exploring-future" role="doc-biblioref">Weerasinghe et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 2</code> <code>citations: 0</code></p>

<p>The common topic in this cluster of texts is the mathematical modeling and assessment of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic. The texts discuss the use of social distancing, mask-wearing, and other interventions as strategies for controlling and mitigating the spread of the virus. They also highlight the importance of vaccination and the effectiveness of different intervention scenarios in reducing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Mathematical models are used to analyze the population-level impact of these interventions and to make projections for the future trajectory of the pandemic. Overall, the texts focus on the quantitative assessment and modeling of various strategies to combat COVID-19.<br>

A mathematical model was developed to assess the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. The model showed that maintaining strict social-distancing measures until the end of May or June could significantly reduce the worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality. The study also emphasized the importance of social-distancing and the use of face-masks, with higher adherence levels resulting in a dramatic reduction in the burden of the pandemic. Combining low efficacy masks with other intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. <span class="citation" data-cites="ngonghala-NA-mathematical-assessment">(<a href="#ref-ngonghala-NA-mathematical-assessment" role="doc-biblioref">Ngonghala et al. 1800</a>)</span> <code>degree: 8</code> <code>citations: NA</code><br>
Future scenarios for COVID-19 dynamics in the UK were predicted using a mathematical model that incorporated vaccination rollout and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The study found that vaccination alone is insufficient to control the outbreak, and even with optimistic assumptions, the reproduction number (R) is estimated to be 1.58 once all eligible adults have been vaccinated. Removing all NPIs after vaccination is predicted to result in a significant number of deaths, emphasizing the importance of continued NPIs alongside vaccination. <span class="citation" data-cites="moore-2021-vaccination-and">(<a href="#ref-moore-2021-vaccination-and" role="doc-biblioref">Moore et al. 2021</a>)</span> <code>degree: 17</code> <code>citations: 258</code><br>
Modeling future scenarios of COVID-19 in the United States based on case and mortality data, a SEIR model predicts that cumulative deaths could reach 511,373 by February 2021 if current intervention strategies continue. However, achieving universal mask use could potentially save an additional 129,574 lives, or 95,814 lives with a lesser adoption of mask wearing, mitigating the effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. <span class="citation" data-cites="reiner-2021-modeling-covid-19">(<a href="#ref-reiner-2021-modeling-covid-19" role="doc-biblioref">Reiner et al. 2021</a>)</span> <code>degree: 7</code> <code>citations: 223</code><br>
Short-term forecasting models, including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning, were evaluated for predicting COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states. SVR and stacking-ensemble learning demonstrated better performance, achieving accurate forecasting with errors ranging from 0.87% to 6.90% in different time horizons. These models can assist decision-making in managing the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases.

Assessing the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 is crucial for future preparedness plans. Using a combination of computational techniques, statistical inference, and artificial intelligence tools, this study quantifies the impact of over 6,000 NPIs implemented in 79 territories on the effective reproduction number of the virus. The findings demonstrate that a combination of NPIs is necessary to control the spread of the virus, with less disruptive and costly measures proving to be as effective as more drastic interventions like national lockdowns. Moreover, by analyzing different scenarios based on the timing of NPI deployment, the study provides insights into the effectiveness of future interventions. Overall, this research highlights the potential effectiveness of softer measures such as risk communication and healthcare capacity enhancement in curbing the spread of COVID-19. <span class="citation" data-cites="haug-2020-ranking-effectiveness">(<a href="#ref-haug-2020-ranking-effectiveness" role="doc-biblioref">Haug et al. 2020</a>)</span> <code>degree: 13</code> <code>citations: 594</code><br>
Inferring change points in the spread of COVID-19 reveals the effectiveness of interventions by combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, detecting change points in the effective growth rate of new infections that correlate well with publicly announced interventions in Germany, quantifying the effect of interventions and incorporating these change points into forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers. <span class="citation" data-cites="dehning-2020-inferring-change">(<a href="#ref-dehning-2020-inferring-change" role="doc-biblioref">Dehning et al. 2020</a>)</span> <code>degree: 10</code> <code>citations: 372</code><br>

This study investigates the use of a dynamic model and machine learning models for analyzing and predicting infectious outbreaks, specifically focusing on the case of COVID-19. The dynamic model is shown to be effective for long-term analysis and parameter estimation but not for long-term forecasting. On the other hand, machine learning models, such as ANFIS and RBF, demonstrate better performance in disease prediction. Various metrics, including RMSE, R-Squared, and accuracy, are utilized to evaluate the machine learning models. <span class="citation" data-cites="rakhshan-2023-global-analysis">(<a href="#ref-rakhshan-2023-global-analysis" role="doc-biblioref">Rakhshan et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 2</code> <code>citations: 0</code><br>

The tungsten programme in ASDEX Upgrade aims to achieve a full high-Z device by extending and refining the spectroscopic diagnostic of tungsten and re-evaluating its cooling factor. While the majority of plasma facing components are now coated with tungsten, critical issues such as anomalous transport and impurity concentration need to be addressed for successful operation. Remedies such as central RF heating, increased ELM frequency, and moderate gas puffing have shown promise in mitigating these issues, although they may affect confinement. Impurity transport calculations suggest that strong high-Z accumulation is not expected in the ITER standard scenario as long as anomalous transport is sufficiently high.

The integrated simulation analysis of the HL-2M high-parameter hybrid scenario reveals that a hybrid scenario with a typical safety factor q profile, achieved through the joint injection method of neutral beam and electron cyclotron wave, yields a normalized toroidal beta (beta (N)) of 2.39. By considering the effect of impurity concentration (Z (eff)) and pedestal density (n (e,ped)), a higher parameters hybrid scenario with beta (N) reaching 3.118 is obtained, indicating that there is an optimal Z (eff) value for optimal confinement, which decreases with the increase of n (e,ped).

This paper reviews the methodological advances in urban water demand modeling, within the framework of coupled human and natural systems, focusing on four central themes: spatial and temporal scales, uncertainty, system response, and the transition to dynamic modeling. The review concludes that technological and statistical innovations have led to increasingly effective models that provide accurate estimates of urban water demand determinants at fine resolution, with a trend towards incorporating alternative future scenarios and stochastic analysis. <span class="citation" data-cites="house-peters-2011-urban-water">(<a href="#ref-house-peters-2011-urban-water" role="doc-biblioref">House-Peters and Chang 2011</a>)</span> <code>degree: 13</code> <code>citations: 261</code><br>
This literature review examines urban water demand forecasting from 2000 to 2010, highlighting the range of methods and models utilized for decision making in water utilities. The study emphasizes the importance of tailoring the choice of model based on the forecast variable, periodicity, and horizon. Short-term forecasting commonly utilizes artificial neural networks, while long-term strategic decisions often rely on econometric models coupled with simulation or scenario-based forecasting. However, future research should prioritize the development of probabilistic forecasting methods to account for uncertainty in demand forecasts. <span class="citation" data-cites="donkor-2014-urban-water">(<a href="#ref-donkor-2014-urban-water" role="doc-biblioref">Donkor et al. 2014</a>)</span> <code>degree: 13</code> <code>citations: 243</code><br>
This paper investigates the potential benefits of using uncertainty predictions in seasonal inflow volumes for improved reservoir release decisions, highlighting the complex dependence of optimal release and objective function on reservoir parameters and uncertain inflow forcing. The study finds that predicted inflow uncertainty is particularly beneficial when operating near reservoir capacity or near zero reservoir volume, but errors in predicted uncertainty can lead to suboptimal release decisions and significant operation losses. The presence of binding release constraints also hinders the benefits of uncertainty predictions, suggesting the need for less rigid release policies. The study further identifies the reservoir capacity values that are most sensitive to seasonal inflow uncertainty predictions. Suggestions for further research in this area are provided. <span class="citation" data-cites="georgakakos-2008-potential-benefits">(<a href="#ref-georgakakos-2008-potential-benefits" role="doc-biblioref">Georgakakos and Graham 2008</a>)</span> <code>degree: 15</code> <code>citations: 44</code><br>

This paper examines the impact of streamflow forecast uncertainty on real-time reservoir operation, considering various forecast products such as deterministic streamflow forecast (DSF), DSF-based probabilistic streamflow forecast (pseudo-PSF, pPSF), and ensemble or probabilistic streamflow forecast (real-PSF, rPSF). The study demonstrates that forecast uncertainty has a significant effect on reservoir operation efficiency, with rPSF performing nearly as well as a perfect forecast, while DSF and pPSF are less effective. Additionally, streamflow variability and reservoir capacity can influence the magnitude but not the relative performance of the forecast products.

<p>The main topic of this cluster is the impact of acid deposition and drought-induced acidification on soil and water chemistry in different ecosystems. The texts discuss the relationship between nitrogen input and nitrate leaching in European forests, the importance of base cation deposition in mitigating acid rain and acidification in China, the mobility of dissolved organic carbon in peat soils under drought conditions, changes in acidification of lochs in Scotland over time, and the sensitivity of soil calcium supply and stream acid neutralizing capacity to whole-tree harvest. The texts also mention the modelling of future impacts of biomass harvesting and climate change on acid-sensitive catchments in Finland, as well as the prediction of metal release from peat due to drought-induced acidification. Therefore, the common topic of these texts is the understanding and prediction of the effects of acid deposition and drought-induced acidification on soil and water chemistry in various ecosystems.<br>

The study analyzes the IFEF database to evaluate the relationship between nitrogen input and nitrate leaching in European forests, finding that nitrate leaching is strongly dependent on nitrogen deposition and that the C/N ratio in the organic horizon can be used as an indicator of nitrate leaching, particularly when stratified based on C/N ratios.

Acid rain and acidification in China are major environmental concerns, with previous studies primarily focusing on sulfur deposition and precipitation pH. However, the presence of high concentrations of alkaline dust in many parts of China necessitates consideration of base cation deposition to understand its effects on soil and vegetation. By analyzing both measured and modeled data, we estimate the regional deposition of sulfur and calcium, the dominant anion and cation, respectively, in China. The ratio of sulfur to calcium deposition serves as an indicator of areas where deposition acidity exceeds alkalinity, posing a risk of soil acidification. Using the MAGIC model, we demonstrate significant soil acidification over the past few decades due to acid deposition in two highly impacted sites in southwest China. We also illustrate the potential effects of different future deposition scenarios on the spatial distribution of acidic deposition in China. Considering that the anthropogenic fraction of base cation deposition remains uncertain, we explore various possible trends in calcium deposition. Model predictions reveal the soil response under different combinations of sulfur and calcium deposition scenarios. Notably, implementing stringent measures to reduce sulfur emissions can effectively address the acid deposition problem. <span class="citation" data-cites="larssen-2000-acid-rain">(<a href="#ref-larssen-2000-acid-rain" role="doc-biblioref">Larssen and Carmichael 2000</a>)</span> <code>degree: 4</code> <code>citations: 294</code><br>
Future scenarios suggest that drought-induced acidification can significantly affect the mobility of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in peat soils, as demonstrated by a 10-year time series analysis. Drought conditions were found to have a strong relationship with DOC and sulphate dynamics, resulting in lower DOC concentrations due to drought-induced acidification. This finding has implications for understanding the impact of climate change on DOC suppression in soil and stream waters during drought events. <span class="citation" data-cites="clark-2005-influence-drought-induced">(<a href="#ref-clark-2005-influence-drought-induced" role="doc-biblioref">Clark et al. 2005</a>)</span> <code>degree: 4</code> <code>citations: 229</code><br>
Decreased acidic deposition in the Galloway area of Scotland from 1979 to 1988 resulted in changes in water chemistry, as demonstrated by a survey of 50 lochs. The MAGIC model successfully reproduced these changes and can be used to evaluate the future impact of acidic deposition and afforestation on fish status in the region. Afforestation was found to further acidify the lochs if acidic deposition remained at 1988 levels. Acidic deposition was identified as the main cause of soil and water acidification, with forestry practices exacerbating the effects. <span class="citation" data-cites="wright-1994-changes-acidification">(<a href="#ref-wright-1994-changes-acidification" role="doc-biblioref">WRIGHT et al. 1994</a>)</span> <code>degree: 13</code> <code>citations: 47</code><br>
This study modeled the long-term effects of whole-tree harvest on soil and stream water acidity in Swedish forested catchments using the MAGIC model, finding that all three sites experienced large depletions in soil calcium supply and a reversal of the positive trend in stream acid neutralizing capacity, with the largest decrease in acid neutralizing capacity observed at the well-buffered site, Gammtratten, and the effects at Kindla and Aneboda being more limited and not large enough to offset the general recovery from acidification; sensitivity analyses showed that varying tree biomass calcium concentrations had the largest impact on the modelled outcomes, followed by site productivity, while changing biomass amounts left on site only marginally affected the results, and the reliability of the modelled outcomes could be improved by using site-specific calcium concentrations in tree biomass and field-determined identification of site productivity. <span class="citation" data-cites="zetterberg-2014-sensitivity-analyses">(<a href="#ref-zetterberg-2014-sensitivity-analyses" role="doc-biblioref">Zetterberg, Kohler, and Lofgren 2014</a>)</span> <code>degree: 11</code> <code>citations: 26</code><br>
The study found that while reductions in atmospheric deposition and biomass harvesting improved soil and lake water chemistry in acid-sensitive catchments in Finland, further reductions are still needed. The “MFR” scenario predicted long-term improvement in soil base saturation and continued recovery in surface waters, while the “WTH” scenario predicted re-acidification and negative impacts on soil and surface water chemistry. Increased utilization of biofuels will require balancing emissions with soil amendment to maintain ecosystem quality and sustainable forest growth. The current practice of sustainable maximum harvesting (SOH) is close to the limit for current atmospheric deposition in Finland. <span class="citation" data-cites="aherne-2008-modelling-hydro-geochemistry">(<a href="#ref-aherne-2008-modelling-hydro-geochemistry" role="doc-biblioref">Aherne et al. 2008</a>)</span> <code>degree: 20</code> <code>citations: 24</code><br>
The study used the MAGIC model to predict the response of Finnish lake catchments to future acidic deposition and climatic change scenarios, based on European emission reduction policies and maximum feasible reductions, as well as climate projections from two global scenarios (IPCC A2 and B2). The study also examined the potential influence of changes in surface water organic carbon concentrations.

Drought-induced acidification of ombrotrophic peat in northern England and Scotland, caused by the conversion of reduced peat sulfur to sulfuric acid, is predicted to lower soil solution pH and release potentially toxic metals. Simulation modeling suggests that pH decreases and increases in dissolved metal concentrations will occur during rewetting periods following droughts, with the severity of pH depressions declining gradually due to slow depletion of the soil sulfur pool but heavy metal pulses declining rapidly due to insufficient metal deposition to compensate for leaching losses.

The decline in nitrogen (N) deposition across Europe has led to decreased N inputs in forest ecosystems, particularly in Central and Western Europe with high deposition levels. Observational studies on various indicators such as soil acidification, understory vegetation, tree nutrition, vitality, and growth show varied ecosystem responses to decreasing N deposition.

This study aimed to develop optimal management strategies to mitigate soil acidification and minimize nutrient losses in croplands by assessing the impacts of different nutrient management scenarios on soil pH and nutrient budgets. The results showed that replacing 70% of nitrogen fertilizer input with manure effectively neutralized acidity production and maintaining the soil pH. Additionally, balancing nitrogen and phosphorus input with crop demand significantly reduced nutrient surplus, while substituting nitrogen fertilizer with manure counteracted acidification. An optimized combination of fertilizer, manure, and lime was identified to minimize acidification and unnecessary phosphorus accumulation.

Modelling the probability of rainfall-induced shallow landslides in a changing climate in Otta, Central Norway, we analyzed slope stability conditions considering present and future scenarios, taking into account changes in precipitation, uncertainty in model parameters, and evaluating the contributing factors to model output and uncertainty. Using a hydrological-stability model, we studied the hydrological control on shallow landslides in different precipitation regimes, including climatic settings, extreme events, and antecedent precipitation conditions. By employing the Monte Carlo approach and conducting sensitivity analysis, we determined probabilities of failure for present and future conditions, revealing that changes in stability conditions only occur when the effect of antecedent precipitation is not considered. However, due to uncertainties in predicted extreme precipitation events, soil parameters, and antecedent precipitation conditions, accurate estimation of changes in stability conditions for shallow landslides is not possible. <span class="citation" data-cites="melchiorre-2012-modelling-probability">(<a href="#ref-melchiorre-2012-modelling-probability" role="doc-biblioref">Melchiorre and Frattini 2012</a>)</span> <code>degree: 15</code> <code>citations: 61</code><br>

The cost of lipid production for a 10% return is estimated at $8.52/gal for open ponds and $18.10/gal for PBRs, with additional costs for hydrotreating. The study suggests that future improvements in microalgal strains that can sustain high growth rates and lipid content could significantly reduce production costs. Sensitivity studies and resource assessments were also conducted to identify important cost drivers and evaluate water and CO(2) requirements.

Understanding how plant communities assemble is crucial for predicting their behavior under future environmental scenarios, and while the traditional concept of assembly rules suggests that species co-occur non-randomly due to interspecific competition, a meta-analysis of 59 papers indicates that non-random co-occurrence is not widespread, although this finding could be influenced by methodological shortcomings, highlighting the need for more comprehensive surveys using standardized methods to test for assembly rules at larger scales. <span class="citation" data-cites="gotzenberger-2012-ecological-assembly">(<a href="#ref-gotzenberger-2012-ecological-assembly" role="doc-biblioref">Gotzenberger et al. 2012</a>)</span> <code>degree: 4</code> <code>citations: 621</code><br>
Future scenarios for global atmospheric emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) indicate a decrease in emissions by 46-71% in developed countries and 48-64% in developing countries from 2009 to 2030, based on six IPCC SRES scenarios. The potential health impact of these emissions is greatest in regions with high anthropogenic emissions and high population densities. <span class="citation" data-cites="shen-2013-global-atmospheric">(<a href="#ref-shen-2013-global-atmospheric" role="doc-biblioref">Shen et al. 2013</a>)</span> <code>degree: 5</code> <code>citations: 579</code><br>

Climate change can significantly impact the behavior and distribution of organic pollutants, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), through various direct effects such as temperature increase, changes in precipitation and wind patterns, sea level rise, and alterations in snow and ice cover, leading to alterations in partitioning of POPs among environmental compartments and degradation rates, soil properties, air-particle partitioning, and more; a case study conducted in the Venice Lagoon (Italy) using a dynamic multimedia model demonstrates that even minor environmental changes resulting from different climate change scenarios can cause significant variations in POPs concentrations, with potential implications for their long-range atmospheric transport, although it is suggested that global warming might also reduce the environmental levels of these chemicals.

This study examines the profitability of a photovoltaic (PV) plant in Italy under a collective self-consumption (CSC) scheme, considering different political and market contexts. The results show promising economic returns with low levels of risk, and variations in net present value (NPV) are more significant in market scenarios than policy scenarios. Additionally, the study proposes three scenarios for dividing benefits among renewable self-consumers in a CSC scheme. <span class="citation" data-cites="d">(<a href="#ref-d" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>d?</strong></a>’adamo-2023-photovoltaic-systems)</span> <code>degree: 2</code> <code>citations: 2</code><br>
This paper explores the possibility of producing low carbon and renewable aviation fuel using existing first generation corn biorefineries, through the conversion of corn feedstocks to 1,4-dimethylcyclooctane (DMCO). The study evaluates the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and displacing fossil fuel in the aviation industry, and suggests that corn-to-DMCO could meet sustainable aviation fuel policy targets in the near term, while also acting as a bridge towards the development of biomass-based jet fuel in the future. <span class="citation" data-cites="batten-2023-meeting-sustainable">(<a href="#ref-batten-2023-meeting-sustainable" role="doc-biblioref">Batten et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 2</code> <code>citations: 1</code><br>
Hubble WFC3 spectroscopy of the terrestrial planets L 98-59 c and d finds no evidence for a clear hydrogen-dominated primary atmosphere, leaving open the possibility of a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere with an opaque cloud layer, a secondary thin atmosphere, or no atmosphere at all; future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope are needed to confirm the presence of atmospheres and determine their compositions. <span class="citation" data-cites="zhou-2023-hubble-wfc3">(<a href="#ref-zhou-2023-hubble-wfc3" role="doc-biblioref">Zhou et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 3</code> <code>citations: 1</code><br>

This paper investigates the relationship between fault level and system strength in future renewable-rich power grids, considering the impact of power electronics-based renewable energy sources (RESs) on fault current contribution and system impedance. The study utilizes Thevenin impedance-based fault level estimation and compares it with steady-state and dynamic simulations. The results suggest that while fault level remains a suitable measure for system strength in scenarios with low RES penetrations, it may be misleading in highly penetrated RES grids. The findings are validated using the IEEE nine-bus test system in DIgSILENT PowerFactory. <span class="citation" data-cites="aljarrah-2023-relationship-between">(<a href="#ref-aljarrah-2023-relationship-between" role="doc-biblioref">Aljarrah et al. 2023</a>)</span> <code>degree: 3</code> <code>citations: 0</code></p>
