# These codes create the vocabularies by using the STOPWORD parsing approach.
# Meaning that we split sentences on the stopwords to get nouns 
# Then we do some hacky approach to stem and convert back to natural language.

# The approach may be useful for overly sized datasets. It may be an overkill for any other dataset.
# Additionally, we anyway use the this approach for keyword extraction during the report creation.
