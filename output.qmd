Therefore, the common topic can be named as "Climate Change and its Impacts on Agricultural Systems and Food Production".   
This study examined the potential effects of future climate change, including a doubling of atmospheric CO2, on agricultural production of four different cropping systems at two locations in Italy. The results showed that without modifications to current management practices, the combined effects of elevated CO2 and climate change would lead to a decrease in crop yields by 10-40%. However, adaptation strategies such as early planting and the use of slower-maturing cultivars can help maintain current crop yields. For irrigated crops, additional water may be required to mitigate the impact of climate change on grain yields. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. [@tubiello-2000-effects-climate]  `degree: 72``citations: 258`

[@wotton-2010-forest-fire]  `degree: 45``citations: 304`
The response of terrestrial ecosystems to rising CO2 and climate change is explored using six dynamic global vegetation models driven by the IPCC IS92a scenario of rising CO2 and climate changes resulting from effective CO2 concentrations corresponding to IS92a. The simulations reveal a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink during the 1990s, which continues to rise over a century. However, simulations including climate change show a reduced carbon sink due to the impacts of climate change on ecosystems in the tropics and southern hemisphere. Additionally, the rate of increase in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) begins to level off around 2030 due to the diminishing return of physiological CO2 effects at high CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, four out of the six models suggest a decline in NEP after 2050 due to increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical net primary productivity. Changes in vegetation structure also have an impact on the carbon sink and freshwater availability. These findings highlight the need to consider biospheric influences on the carbon balance in future scenarios of atmospheric CO2 and climate change, as well as the uncertainties surrounding the response of NEP to climate change.

Acid rain and acidification in China are major environmental concerns, with previous studies primarily focusing on sulfur deposition and precipitation pH. However, the presence of high concentrations of alkaline dust in many parts of China necessitates consideration of base cation deposition to understand its effects on soil and vegetation. By analyzing both measured and modeled data, we estimate the regional deposition of sulfur and calcium, the dominant anion and cation, respectively, in China. The ratio of sulfur to calcium deposition serves as an indicator of areas where deposition acidity exceeds alkalinity, posing a risk of soil acidification. Using the MAGIC model, we demonstrate significant soil acidification over the past few decades due to acid deposition in two highly impacted sites in southwest China. We also illustrate the potential effects of different future deposition scenarios on the spatial distribution of acidic deposition in China. Considering that the anthropogenic fraction of base cation deposition remains uncertain, we explore various possible trends in calcium deposition. Model predictions reveal the soil response under different combinations of sulfur and calcium deposition scenarios. Notably, implementing stringent measures to reduce sulfur emissions can effectively address the acid deposition problem. [@larssen-2000-acid-rain]  `degree: 4``citations: 294`
