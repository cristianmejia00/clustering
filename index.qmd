#### Cluster 1: Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation
The common topic of the cluster is climate change and its impacts on various aspects such as precipitation patterns, flood risk, hydrological modeling, and regional climate projections. The texts discuss the projections of climate change in the Mediterranean region, the potential to reduce uncertainty in regional climate predictions, downscaling techniques for hydrological modeling, global flood risk, and the assessment of climate change impacts on hydrology. They also touch upon the importance of adaptation, the role of climate models in predicting future climate, and the need for effective floodplain management strategies. Overall, the cluster provides insights into the current understanding of climate change and its implications for different regions and sectors.    
**Articles:**  
Climate change projections for the Mediterranean region indicate a decrease in precipitation, particularly in the warm season, except for the northern Mediterranean areas in winter, due to increased anticyclonic circulation and a northward shift of the Atlantic storm track, along with a pronounced warming, maximum in the summer season, leading to a greater occurrence of extremely high temperature events, with the projections by global and regional models generally consistent but with substantial orographically-induced fine scale structure in the regional models, suggesting that the Mediterranean might be an especially vulnerable region to global change. [@giorgi-2008-climate-change]  `degree: 176` `citations: 2045`  
The study examines the potential for climate science to reduce uncertainty in regional climate predictions, finding that model uncertainty is more significant than internal variability and that reducing uncertainty could have significant economic value for managing adaptation to a changing climate. [@hawkins-2009-potential-narrow]  `degree: 197` `citations: 1542`  
Recent advances in downscaling techniques for hydrological modelling have allowed for the linking of climate change modelling to impacts studies, with new developments in climate scenario construction offering potential for advancement within the 'downscaling for hydrological impacts' community, including probabilistic modelling, pattern scaling, and downscaling of multiple variables, which can be merged with downscaling techniques in a probabilistic climate change scenario framework to assess uncertainties associated with future projections; however, there is still limited consideration given to applied research within hydrological impact studies. [@fowler-2007-linking-climate]  `degree: 544` `citations: 1536`  
This study presents global flood risk projections for the end of the century, using outputs from 11 climate models and a state-of-the-art global river routing model, and demonstrates a significant increase in flood frequency in Southeast Asia, Peninsular India, eastern Africa, and the northern half of the Andes, with some areas projected to experience a decrease in flood frequency, highlighting the need for adaptation measures in the face of future climate change. [@hirabayashi-2013-global-flood]  `degree: 128` `citations: 1414`  
Six approaches for downscaling climate model outputs for hydrologic simulation were evaluated, with emphasis on producing precipitation and other variables at higher spatial resolution; the study compared three statistical downscaling methods applied to both direct climate model output and after dynamical downscaling, finding that bias-correction and spatial disaggregation produced the best results. [@wood-2004-hydrologic-implications]  `degree: 371` `citations: 1251`  
This paper presents SDSM, a decision support tool that uses statistical downscaling techniques to assess local climate change impacts, by generating multiple, low-cost, single-site scenarios of daily surface weather variables under current and future regional climate forcing, and demonstrates its application in generating temperature and precipitation scenarios for Toronto, Canada by 2040-2069. (48 words) [@wilby-2002-sdsm--]  `degree: 302` `citations: 799`  
This study compares different sources of uncertainty for climate change impacts on flood frequency in England, finding that the largest source of uncertainty is the structure of the General Circulation Models (GCMs) used, particularly due to the extreme increases in winter rainfall predicted by one of the five GCMs. However, other sources of uncertainty, such as future climate modeling and hydrological modeling, become more significant if the results from this GCM are omitted, highlighting the importance of understanding current and future natural variability in assessing climate change impacts on hydrology. [@kay-2009-comparison-uncertainty]  `degree: 208` `citations: 431`  
This study assesses the impact of future climate change on the hydrology of the Gidabo river sub-basin in the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes Basin, using a climate ensemble of Regional Climate Model outputs and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The results indicate a decline in mean annual surface runoff, water yield, and actual evapotranspiration, which could lead to reduced soil moisture availability for crop production, highlighting the need for watershed development and management practices to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture and water supply. [@aragaw-2023-assessing-impact]  `degree: 23` `citations: 0`  
This study assesses the impacts of climate change on flooding in the river Chenab, Pakistan, under future scenarios. Various climate models were used to evaluate future streamflow and floodplain flows, and statistical distributions were employed to assess flood return periods. The results indicate an increase in flood inundation extent, highlighting the importance of using predicted climate data for effective floodplain management strategies. [@kiran-2023-assessing-impacts]  `degree: 21` `citations: 0`  
This study developed a probabilistic risk assessment approach to quantify urban flood risk and assess the impacts of future climate change, finding that the risk of urban flooding is projected to increase by 51.3% to 67.4% under different climate change scenarios, with the largest increases occurring in forestlands and grasslands, highlighting the importance of these findings for informed decision making in urban flood prevention. [@liu-2023-probabilistic-assessment]  `degree: 20` `citations: 0`  
A refined scenario-neutral approach is proposed to assess the potential hydroclimatological impacts of changing climatic conditions in Quebec, Canada, considering the sensitivity of systems, differential analysis of climatic stressors, paths of change, and categorized response of scenarios. The results indicate regional and differential behaviors in hydroclimatology, annual water balances, and snow, with a plausible scenario showing reduced snow, decreased low flows (varying between basins), and increased dry events despite current mean annual flows remaining unchanged due to temperature and precipitation increases. [@giraldo-2023-assessment-the]  `degree: 23` `citations: 0`  
Future scenarios of concurrent long-duration dry and hot (LDDH) events in China during summer were investigated using fourteen global climate models (GCMs) downscaled by four statistical downscaling methods. The downscaling methods improved the accuracy of LDDH characteristics and the three quantile mapping based techniques outperformed the cumulative distribution function transform. All downscaling methods projected an increasing tendency for the frequency, magnitude, and total days of LDDH events in China, with higher increases under RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5. Model uncertainty dominated throughout the century, but scenario uncertainty became more important towards the end of the century for the projection of temperature magnitude of LDDH events.

#### Cluster 2: Climate Change and Species Distribution
The common topic of the cluster is the impact of climate change on species distribution and biodiversity. The texts discuss the shifts in species distributions and abundances, the risks of species extinction, the classification of climate conditions, the modeling of range-shifting species, the threats to plant diversity, the prediction of species' range shifts, and the validation of species-climate impact models. They also address the development of novel climates, the variability and uncertainties in projections, and the implications for conservation. Overall, the cluster highlights the urgent need to address climate change and implement strategies to mitigate its effects on species and ecosystems. Therefore, the common topic can be named "Climate Change and Species Distribution."    
**Articles:**  
Future climate change scenarios predict that 15-37% of species in sample regions will be 'committed to extinction' by 2050, emphasizing the urgent need for greenhouse gas emission reduction technologies and carbon sequestration strategies. [@thomas-2004-extinction-risk]  `degree: 632` `citations: 5129`  
New global maps of the Koppen-Geiger climate classification at an unprecedented 1-km resolution for the present-day and future scenarios (under climate change) are presented, offering higher accuracy, more detail, and valuable indications of classification reliability, with potential applications in species and vegetation distribution modeling. [@beck-2018-present-and]  `degree: 33` `citations: 1890`  
This study explores modelling approaches to minimize extrapolation errors and assess predictions of range-shifting species against prior biological knowledge, using the invasive cane toad in Australia as an example. The results highlight the need for methods and tools to understand models and predictions, and demonstrate that controlling the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions in non-equilibrium and novel settings. These findings have important implications for managing biodiversity in the face of species invasions and climate change. [@elith-NA-art-modelling]  `degree: 383` `citations: NA`  
Future scenarios of climate change in Europe indicate that more than half of the studied plant species could become severely threatened by 2080, with highly variable expected species loss and turnover across scenarios and regions, and a disproportionate sensitivity of mountain species to climate change; the transition between the Mediterranean and Euro-Siberian regions is expected to experience the greatest changes. [@thuiller-2005-climate-change]  `degree: 347` `citations: 1687`  
Bagging Trees (BT) and Random Forests (RF) were found to be superior in reproducing current importance value distributions for four tree species, and were also more reasonable in estimating suitable habitat after climate change, making them robust techniques for predictive vegetation mapping under future climate scenarios. [@prasad-2006-newer-classification]  `degree: 51` `citations: 1468`  
Future scenarios of climate change will lead to the emergence of no-analog communities, characterized by novel climates that are warmer than any present climates globally, with variable shifts in precipitation, increasing the risk of species reshuffling and other ecological surprises, highlighting the need to test the robustness of ecological models to these conditions. [@williams-2007-novel-climates]  `degree: 101` `citations: 1131`  
Validation of species-climate impact models under climate change is crucial due to the significant variability in model predictions and the need to reduce uncertainties; however, model validation is challenging as predictions are made for future events, and current approaches suffer from spatial and temporal autocorrelation issues. In this study, using observed distribution shifts among 116 British breeding-bird species over the past 20 years, four envelope modelling techniques were independently validated, showing good to fair predictive performance, although the interpretation of model performance in a decision-planning context is difficult. Artificial neural networks and generalized additive models outperformed generalized linear models and classification tree analysis in predicting species range shifts. While perfect validation may not be conceptually possible, the usefulness of models depends on the questions being asked and the techniques used. [@araujo-2005-validation-species-climate]  `degree: 249` `citations: 1115`  
This study examines the patterns and uncertainties of species' range shifts under climate change, finding that while there is high potential for species turnover in response to climate change, the variability in projections arising from different niche-based models obscures the potential distributional changes of species across climate scenarios, highlighting the need to explicitly quantify model uncertainty when discussing future species distributions and community descriptors. The study also proposes and tests an alternative method to account for modelling variability when estimating species turnover under different climate change scenarios. [@thuiller-2004-patterns-and]  `degree: 172` `citations: 630`  
This study aims to predict the future habitat distributions of two endemic oak tree species, Quercus infectoria and Quercus libani, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq's mountain ranges under climate change scenarios, using distribution data, environmental factors, machine learning, and geospatial techniques. The results indicate that both species' habitat ranges would contract, with some expansion in certain areas, and emphasize the importance of conserving the mountain areas where the species overlap for effective biodiversity conservation in the face of climate change in Iraq. [@hama-2023-predictive-mapping]  `degree: 28` `citations: 1`  
This study used optimized maximum entropy models to predict the potential distribution areas for Thesium chinense Turcz. in China, both in the present and future, under different climate scenarios. The results showed that the highly suitable areas were primarily located in Shandong and Shanxi Provinces, with a relatively stable habitat in South Central Shanxi, Eastern Gansu, and Midwest Guizhou. Additionally, the analysis indicated that the potential habitat of the plant migrated in a northwesterly direction under various climatic conditions. [@gao-2023-prediction-potentially]  `degree: 23` `citations: 0`  
This study utilized eBird and GBIF data to develop Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and predict the potential impacts of climate change on terrestrial avifauna in India. The findings suggest that a significant proportion of bird species in India will shift to higher elevations or northward, resulting in changes in their distribution ranges. Additionally, bird species diversity is expected to increase in regions above 2500 m in elevation, and the western Himalayas, Sikkim, northeast India, and the western Ghats regions are predicted to experience extensive changes in species richness by 2070. These results align with predictions made for avifauna in other regions, such as Europe and the USA. [@deomurari-2023-projected-shifts]  `degree: 30` `citations: 0`  
Future scenarios of habitat suitability for the critically endangered plant species Commiphora wightii in India indicate that its potentially suitable bioclimatic distribution will increase under all future projections (2090 > 2050 ≈ current), except for 2070, suggesting that there are more suitable habitats available for artificial cultivation and future projections. Additionally, the species was found to favor various types of landforms outside rocky environments, such as sand dunes, sandy plains, and saline areas. The study also highlighted the importance of considering both bioclimatic and non-bioclimatic variables in understanding the effects on species distribution. [@mathur-2023-ecological-niche]  `degree: 24` `citations: 0`  
Future scenarios of climate change pose a significant risk to alpine graminoid species, particularly the 79 Kobresia species in China, as their distributional ranges are likely to shrink to critical sizes, with around 40% of the species facing the risk of extinction due to climate-induced range shifts, emphasizing the urgent need for adaptation measures to mitigate the potential impacts of rapid warming on these cold-adapted mountain species.

This paper presents the methodology and results of an energy system analysis for a 100% renewable energy system in Denmark in the years 2030 and 2050, showing that a 100% renewable energy supply based on domestic resources is physically possible, but Denmark will need to consider the trade-offs between relying on biomass resources or wind power. [@lund-2009-energy-system]  `degree: 95` `citations: 744`  
This study presents future scenarios of global plastic waste generation and disposal, projecting that the production of mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) could triple to 155-265 million metric tonnes per year by 2060 if no action is taken. The African and Asian continents are expected to have disproportionately high MPW loads, but this growth can be reduced through investments in waste management infrastructures and international efforts to reduce plastic in municipal solid waste. Additionally, the study highlights that rivers play a significant role in transporting MPW to the ocean, with 91% of MPW being transported through watersheds larger than 100 km².

New scenarios for climate change research are needed to explore the potential consequences of different response options, including mitigation and adaptation, and to facilitate information exchange among physical, biological, and social scientists. Here, we present a new process for developing plausible future scenarios to address these crucial questions. [@moss-2010-next-generation]  `degree: 480` `citations: 4401`  
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) aims to address scientific gaps from previous phases and fill specific knowledge gaps by utilizing the DECK and CMIP historical simulations, CMIP data standards, and a set of CMIP6-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will focus on future climate scenarios, addressing questions related to Earth system response to forcing, model biases, and assessing future climate changes given variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios. [@eyring-2016-overview-the]  `degree: 400` `citations: 3501`  
The Precision-Recall (PR) plot should be favored over the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) plot when evaluating binary classifiers on imbalanced datasets, as the ROC plot can be misleading in these scenarios due to an incorrect interpretation of specificity, while the PR plot accurately predicts future classification performance by evaluating the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. This has implications for the interpretation of numerous studies that utilize ROC plots on imbalanced datasets. [@saito-2015-precision-recall-plot]  `degree: 4` `citations: 1512`  
A new scenario framework for climate change research, called Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), combines future radiative forcing and socioeconomic development pathways to study climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. SSPs are reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in society and ecosystems, and a space of challenges to adaptation and mitigation is defined within the framework. The development of basic SSPs, which can be extended for specific purposes, is proposed, along with an iterative process of application that may lead to modifications of the initial SSPs.

Reductions in non-methane short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) in eastern and southern Asia will increase global surface warming, temperature extremes, and precipitation extremes, leading to significant population exposure risks in these regions. [@li-2023-impacts-reductions]  `degree: 15` `citations: 0`  
This study examines the expected variabilities in different drought conditions, the population exposure to drought, and the total exposure attributed to individual factors such as climate and population in future climate change scenarios in India. The results indicate that severe and extreme droughts are likely to increase under all scenarios, with the highest exposure observed under the SSP3-7.0 scenario. The study emphasizes the need for effective measures to mitigate the risk, particularly in high-risk areas of India. [@das-2023-population-exposure]  `degree: 17` `citations: 0`  
Future scenarios of climate change emergence under a high emissions scenario show lower S/N in Central Africa, South Asia, and parts of South America, West Africa, East Asia, and Western Europe, but higher in most other populated areas due to higher effective climate sensitivity in CMIP6 ensemble and changes to emissions pathways, effective radiative forcing, and region-scale climate responses. The first population-weighted calculation of climate change emergence for CMIP6 confirms the expected inequity of impacts and emphasizes the need for simultaneous mitigation and adaptation efforts.

#### Cluster 6: Climate Change and its Impacts on Agricultural Systems and Food Production
The common topic of the cluster is the impact of climate change on agricultural systems, specifically on cropping systems and food production. The articles discuss various aspects such as the effects of elevated CO2 and climate change on crop yields, the consequences of climate change on global food production and hunger, methane production by ruminants contributing to global warming, the role of crop diversification in building resilience, the impact of climate change on global wine quality, methodologies for simulating climate change impacts on crop production, the impact of climate change on winter chill in fruit orchards, the timing of heat and drought stress in spring barley, and the water footprint of wheat production in a semi-arid environment. Overall, the articles highlight the need for adaptation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices in the face of climate change. Therefore, the common topic can be named as "Climate Change and its Impacts on Agricultural Systems and Food Production".    
**Articles:**  
This study examined the potential effects of future climate change, including a doubling of atmospheric CO2, on agricultural production of four different cropping systems at two locations in Italy. The results showed that without modifications to current management practices, the combined effects of elevated CO2 and climate change would lead to a decrease in crop yields by 10-40%. However, adaptation strategies such as early planting and the use of slower-maturing cultivars can help maintain current crop yields. For irrigated crops, additional water may be required to mitigate the impact of climate change on grain yields. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. [@tubiello-2000-effects-climate]  `degree: 72` `citations: 258`  
This paper analyzes the global consequences of climate change on crop yields, production, and the risk of hunger under different socio-economic and emissions scenarios. The study uses climate change scenarios developed from the HadCM3 global climate model and evaluates the impacts on crop yields and global cereal production using transfer functions derived from crop model simulations. The results show complex regional patterns of climate variables, CO2 effects, and agricultural systems that contribute to changes in global crop production. The findings suggest that while the world can continue to feed itself under the scenarios considered, there will be significant regional disparities, with poorer nations facing higher prices and increased risk of hunger, particularly under scenarios of greater inequality. The study also highlights the non-linearities in the world food supply system, both in terms of biophysical impacts and socio-economic factors. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. [@parry-2004-effects-climate]  `degree: 154` `citations: 1114`  
This paper reviews the role of methane in global warming, with a specific focus on its production through enteric fermentation in ruminants, highlighting the need for research on new anti-methanogenic compounds, alternative electron accepters, and reduction in protozoal numbers in the rumen to mitigate methane emissions while considering the importance of ruminants in providing high-quality protein sources. [@moss-2000-methane-production]  `degree: 1` `citations: 878`  
Implementing increased crop diversification in agriculture can improve resilience by suppressing pest outbreaks and buffering crop production from climate variability, but slow adoption is hindered by economic incentives, biotechnology strategies, and the misconception that monocultures are more productive. However, diversification can be tailored to provide economic benefits and enhance resilience at different scales and forms. [@lin-2011-resilience-agriculture]  `degree: 8` `citations: 780`  
This study found that from 1950 to 1999, the warming trends in the majority of the world's highest quality wine-producing regions led to increased vintage quality ratings and decreased year-to-year variation, with climate playing a significant role in quality variations; however, future scenarios indicate that the impacts of climate change will not be uniform across all varieties and regions, with European regions currently near their optimum growing season temperatures and New World viticulture regions showing less defined relationships, and model predictions suggesting an average warming of 2 degrees C in the next 50 years for global wine producing regions, which could exceed the climatic threshold for some regions producing high quality grapes at the margins of their climatic limits, making the ripening of balanced fruit for existing varieties and wine styles increasingly difficult, while pushing other regions into more optimal climatic regimes for the production of current varietals and potentially opening up more poleward locations for grape growing and wine production. [@jones-2005-climate-change]  `degree: 72` `citations: 765`  
The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) is an international initiative that aims to improve crop and economic models, as well as climate impact projections, in order to enhance food security and adaptation capacity in light of climate change. By linking climate, crop, and economic models, AgMIP seeks to analyze the effects of climate variability on agriculture and develop strategies for adaptation. The project provides protocols and guidelines for research activities, and pilot studies have shown the importance of considering uncertainties in climate scenarios and model choices when assessing climate impacts on wheat yields and economic projections. Ultimately, integrating multiple models can lead to a better understanding of future agricultural scenarios. [@rosenzweig-2013-agricultural-model]  `degree: 87` `citations: 606`  
Approximately 170 papers have investigated the impact of climate change on crop production and adaptation strategies, focusing on wheat, maize, soybean, and rice, with the USA and Europe being the dominant regions studied. However, the most common approach used in simulating the response to increased CO2 levels does not consider the interacting effects of CO2, stomatal conductance, and canopy temperature, which could worsen the effects of global warming. Additionally, the assumed baseline CO2 concentration often corresponds to conditions 10-30 years earlier than the paper's acceptance date, thereby exaggerating the relative impacts of increased CO2. Furthermore, due to the various scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions, the assumed future CO2 concentrations vary greatly, making comparisons between studies more complicated. Papers focusing on adaptation primarily examined changes in planting dates and cultivars. [@white-2011-methodologies-for]  `degree: 104` `citations: 407`  
Future scenarios of climate change in Mediterranean temperate fruit orchards reveal potential losses of winter chill, irregular and delayed bloom, increased risk of spring frost, exacerbation of bloom-related problems, and more frequent heat waves, highlighting the need for climate change adaptation strategies in the cultivation of temperate trees in this region. [@fernandez-2023-climate-change]  `degree: 18` `citations: 2`  
This study projected the timing of heat and drought stress on spring barley in European sites for the years 2031-2050, and found that shifting sowing dates and choosing appropriate cultivars can mitigate some of the adverse effects, such as earlier heading and grain filling periods due to climate change, though drought conditions are projected to worsen in some regions.

Assessing the impacts of climate change on the water footprint of rainfed and irrigated wheat in a semi-arid environment, our research found that future climates will lead to increased yield in the southern parts of the study area due to higher effective precipitation, while other regions will experience marginal yield decrease or no change for irrigated wheat. Additionally, the water footprint of wheat production is expected to decrease in the southern regions but increase in other regions, making the southern regions more suitable for wheat production in the future.

They also find that adjusting the planting dates can lead to increased yield. The study provides valuable insights for local decision makers in mitigating the effects of future climate change on rice production. [@zhang-2023-impact-climate]  `degree: 14` `citations: 0`  
Future climate change scenarios in Tamil Nadu, India indicate a significant increase in annual maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as an increase in rainfall, potentially leading to a negative impact on the productivity of rice, maize, black gram, and red gram crops, highlighting the need for adaptation strategies to ensure food security in the region.

[@neumann-2015-future-coastal]  `degree: 74` `citations: 1159`  
A semi-empirical approach has been developed to predict future sea-level rise by establishing a relationship between global mean surface temperature and sea-level rise, indicating that the rate of sea-level rise is proportional to the magnitude of warming above pre-Industrial Age temperatures, with a constant of 3.4 millimeters/year per degree Celsius, which leads to a projected sea-level rise in 2100 of 0.5 to 1.4 meters above the 1990 level based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's future warming scenarios. [@rahmstorf-2007-semi-empirical-approach]  `degree: 122` `citations: 1065`  
Antarctica has historically played a significant role in sea-level rise, with past warm periods resulting in much higher global mean sea levels, and the Antarctic ice sheet being identified as the primary contributor; using a model that considers various factors, including the impact of atmospheric warming on ice shelves and cliffs, researchers project that Antarctica could contribute over a meter of sea-level rise by 2100 and more than 15 meters by 2500 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed, with prolonged ocean warming further delaying its recovery for thousands of years. [@deconto-2016-contribution-antarctica]  `degree: 114` `citations: 1045`  
Future scenarios for gas hydrate resources involve incorporating a wide range of geological factors, such as gas hydrate concentration, host lithology, and burial depth, into evaluations of energy resource and environmental concerns, with initial focus on gas-hydrate-bearing sands as the most feasible targets for energy recovery, potentially leading to a global recoverable volume estimate of 3 x 10(13) m(3) (10(15) ft(3)). [@boswell-2011-current-perspectives]  `degree: 7` `citations: 927`  
A proposed relationship between global sea-level variations and global mean temperature, tested on synthetic and observed data and applied to future temperature scenarios, suggests a projected sea-level rise of 75 to 190 cm for the period 1990-2100, with a high correlation of >0.99 and an explanation of 98% of the variance. [@vermeer-2009-global-sea]  `degree: 98` `citations: 723`  
Projected changes in wind-wave climate have significant implications for coastal industries and ecosystems, as well as exacerbating vulnerabilities to sea-level rise; however, these changes have received little attention in global assessments of future climate change. Our study presents the first community-derived multi-model ensemble of wave-climate projections, revealing a projected decrease in annual mean significant wave height over 25.8% of the global ocean area, with a greater decrease during boreal winter. [@hemer-2013-projected-changes]  `degree: 84` `citations: 386`  
Future scenarios for the impact of climate change on storm surges in the Mediterranean Sea suggest that extreme storm surge magnitudes are projected to range between 0.35 and 0.50 m, with higher values along certain northern coasts and the Gulf of Gabes in the southern part of the sea. While the spatial distribution of surge maxima is expected to remain similar to that of the past, there may be variations in their magnitudes depending on the scenario. Specifically, a decrease of surge maxima from -30% to -2% is anticipated towards the end of the 21st century, although some specific coastal sites in Croatia, Spain, Italy, and France might experience an increase of 1% to 22% under different combinations of regional climate models and representative concentration pathways. The study also identifies correlations between deep depression events and high sea levels in various parts of the Mediterranean, with the strongest connections observed along the northern coasts. However, the influence of deep depressions on storm surges is expected to be lower in southern Mediterranean regions, except for the Gulfs of Gabes and Alexandretta. These findings are based on an analysis of storm surge data from the 20th century and projections towards 2100. [@makris-2023-impact-climate]  `degree: 13` `citations: 1`  
We conducted a study using the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM) to explore the sensitivity of ice sheet models to ocean thermal forcing and basal sliding, and found that the initialization methods of these models can significantly impact future sea level rise predictions, with differences of up to 2 meters over several centuries and up to 0.2 meters by the end of this century. We also identified specific ocean and ice parameter combinations that lead to widespread mass loss within 500 years. Our findings highlight the importance of considering these parameter choices in ice sheet simulations for accurate sea level rise predictions and suggest the inclusion of glacial isostatic adjustment in these simulations. [@berdahl-2023-exploring-ice]  `degree: 13` `citations: 0`  
This paper introduces a novel framework, called Probabilistic Sea Level Rise Hazard Analysis (PSLRHA), which utilizes current generation models and protocols to project future sea level rise and quantify uncertainties. The framework produces a global sea level rise hazard map by aggregating probabilities of exceeding specific sea level rise thresholds at different locations. The study also identifies the climate scenarios and sea level rise models that have the greatest impact on extreme thresholds.

This study analyzed the complementarity between wind and solar photovoltaic power in North America from 2025 to 2054 under the SSP2-4.5 scenario using a multi-model ensemble of 10 global climate models. The results showed that the combination of these two resources reduced spatial heterogeneity in power distribution, with optimal complementarity observed in coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, as well as in the US-Canada border and northern regions like Alaska and the Labrador Peninsula. Mexico exhibited the lowest values of complementarity. [@costoya-2023-assessing-complementarity]  `degree: 11` `citations: 0`

#### Cluster 10: The Impacts of Climate Change and Human Activities on Ocean Health
The main topic of the cluster is the impact of climate change and human activities on the oceans, specifically focusing on ocean circulation, ecosystems, biogeochemical cycling, and ocean acidification. The texts discuss future changes in climate, ocean acidification, and the effects on calcifying organisms and marine ecosystems. They also touch upon the role of iron fertilization in carbon sequestration in the Southern Ocean and the impact of riverine nutrient and carbon transport on marine primary production and carbon uptake. Overall, the cluster highlights the potential consequences of climate change and human activities on the health and functioning of the oceans. Thus, the common topic of the cluster is "The Impacts of Climate Change and Human Activities on Ocean Health".    
**Articles:**  
Future scenarios based on a business-as-usual CO2 emission scenario until year 4000 AD reveal significant changes in climate, ocean circulation, ecosystems, and biogeochemical cycling, including a 10-degree Celsius increase in global surface air temperature, sea ice melting, collapse of abyssal ocean circulation, decrease in subsurface oxygen concentrations, quadrupling of global water column denitrification, doubling of global ocean primary production, and a significant increase in atmospheric N2O concentrations. The model also suggests that changes in ocean biology become crucial for carbon uptake after year 2600, contributing to 22% of the atmospheric CO2 increase since the preindustrial era by year 4000. [@schmittner-2008-future-changes]  `degree: 40` `citations: 285`  
Future scenarios of ocean acidification, resulting from increased anthropogenic CO2 emissions, indicate a significant drop in surface water pH and carbonate ion concentrations, leading to aragonite and calcite undersaturation in various regions of the global ocean by 2095, posing a significant threat to marine ecosystems. [@feely-2009-ocean-acidification]  `degree: 48` `citations: 670`  
Future scenarios indicate that marine life forms are threatened by the specific or synergistic effects of ocean warming and acidification, and understanding the mechanisms through which temperature and CO2 affect organism fitness is crucial for accurate predictions of ecosystem effects and quantitative scenarios, as these changes in bioenvelopes may have major implications for geographical distribution and species interactions. [@portner-2008-ecosystem-effects]  `degree: 53` `citations: 628`  
This review examines the interactions and control of photosynthesis and calcification in coral reefs, highlighting the tight coupling between these processes at cellular, organismal, and community levels. The rate of calcification is higher in light than in darkness, contradicting the suggestion that calcification is dark-repressed. However, the ratios of calcification to gross photosynthesis differ between corals and reef communities. The potential impact of global climatic changes on calcification rate is also discussed, with a projected decrease of 10% between 1880 and 1990 and 9-30% (mid estimate: 22%) from 1990 to 2100. The lack of understanding of the calcification mechanism and its interaction with photosynthesis limits accurate predictions of future changes. [@gattuso-1999-photosynthesis-and]  `degree: 14` `citations: 600`  
Observations of a phytoplankton bloom induced by natural iron fertilization in the Southern Ocean suggest that changes in iron supply from below may have a more significant effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations than previously thought, shedding new light on the effect of long-term fertilization on carbon sequestration and supporting future climate change scenarios. [@blain-2007-effect-natural]  `degree: 6` `citations: 574`  
An integrated modeling approach analyzed past trends and four future scenarios of global river nutrient export, revealing that differences in nutrient management in agriculture and sewage treatment significantly impact the magnitude and direction of change in nutrient export, with population changes also playing a crucial role. Regional disparities were observed, with South Asia contributing significantly to the global increase in DIN and DIP river export.

This study examines the impact of riverine transport of nutrients and carbon on future projections of marine primary production (PP) and carbon (C) uptake using an Earth system model. The inclusion of riverine inputs improves the model's simulation of contemporary PP and CO2 fluxes, particularly in continental margins and the North Atlantic region. While riverine nutrient inputs mitigate nutrient limitation under future warmer conditions, reducing the projected decline in PP globally, the impact of riverine carbon on projected C uptake depends on the balance between C uptake and CO2 outgassing. The study suggests that increased riverine carbon may have a larger effect on future ocean C uptake than nutrient inputs. However, the results are subject to limitations related to model resolution and process representation, and further research using high-resolution models is recommended to provide more accurate assessments of future riverine scenarios. [@gao-2023-riverine-impact]  `degree: 7` `citations: 1`  
Future scenarios for the Black Sea suggest that over half of the rivers will experience increased pollution due to declining population trends, economic development, and urbanization, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the impact of these factors on river pollution; however, implementing advanced wastewater treatment measures could lead to a significant decline in pollution levels by 2100, but this would require coordinated international efforts. [@strokal-2023-future-the]  `degree: 5` `citations: 1`  
This study investigates the impact of climate change on coral reefs, specifically focusing on the role of coral adaptive capacity in preventing the transition of reefs into net erosion. The researchers estimate how the ability of coral symbionts to evolve tolerance to heat stress, or for coral hosts to switch to more favorable symbionts, may influence reef responses to ocean warming and acidification. The results demonstrate that symbiont evolution and shuffling can favor positive net reef calcium carbonate production. However, projections of future net calcium carbonate production vary spatially and by emissions scenarios. While some coral reefs may still have positive net calcium carbonate production by 2050 if symbionts can evolve increased thermal tolerance, the number decreases significantly without symbiont adaptive capacity. Overall, the findings suggest that even with symbiont adaptation, coral reefs globally are likely to transition into erosion by 2050 under severe emissions scenarios.

Short-term exposure to seasonal temperatures, projected ocean-warming temperatures, and marine heatwaves had little effect on the nutritional quality of eastern school prawns, but longer-term exposure resulted in changes in fatty acid composition and potential increases in certain elements, highlighting the importance of considering duration of exposure when studying nutritional responses in this species. Additionally, acute warming events could reduce harvestable biomass, underscoring the need to understand the impact of climate change on seafood-derived nutrient security.

#### Cluster 11: The Impact of Climate Change on Forest Fires
The common topic in this cluster of texts is the impact of climate change on forest fires. The texts discuss the relationship between climate change and forest fire occurrence, the effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and function, the increase in forest disturbances and their impact on carbon storage, the projected increase in future area burned, the disruptions to global fire activity, the influence of carbon dioxide on plant responses and continental runoff, and the forest fire potential in boreal forests. These texts highlight the significant impact of climate change on forest fire activity, including increased fire occurrence, severity, and damage. Therefore, the common topic can be framed as "The Impact of Climate Change on Forest Fires."    
**Articles:**  
Climate change is expected to significantly impact forest fire activity in Canada, with projected increases in fire occurrence of 25% by 2030 and 75% by the end of the 21st century according to the Canadian Climate Centre GCM scenarios, and an increase of 140% based on fire climate scenarios derived from the Hadley Centre GCM, indicating that substantial changes to the boreal forest ecosystem are likely unless current climatic trends are altered. [@wotton-2010-forest-fire]  `degree: 45` `citations: 304`  
The response of terrestrial ecosystems to rising CO2 and climate change is explored using six dynamic global vegetation models driven by the IPCC IS92a scenario of rising CO2 and climate changes resulting from effective CO2 concentrations corresponding to IS92a. The simulations reveal a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink during the 1990s, which continues to rise over a century. However, simulations including climate change show a reduced carbon sink due to the impacts of climate change on ecosystems in the tropics and southern hemisphere. Additionally, the rate of increase in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) begins to level off around 2030 due to the diminishing return of physiological CO2 effects at high CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, four out of the six models suggest a decline in NEP after 2050 due to increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical net primary productivity. Changes in vegetation structure also have an impact on the carbon sink and freshwater availability. These findings highlight the need to consider biospheric influences on the carbon balance in future scenarios of atmospheric CO2 and climate change, as well as the uncertainties surrounding the response of NEP to climate change. [@cramer-2001-global-response]  `degree: 100` `citations: 1547`  
Increasing forest disturbances in Europe, caused by wind, bark beetles, and wildfires, have been driven by climate change, and are expected to continue to increase in the coming decades, with a projected reduction of 503.4 Tg C in carbon storage potential in Europe's forests by 2021-2030, emphasizing the need for forest policy and management to prioritize disturbance risk and resilience.

Future area burned in Canada is projected to increase by 74-118% by the end of the century in a 3 x CO2 scenario, according to an analysis of historical weather data, the Canadian fire weather index system, and output from the Canadian and Hadley Centre GCMs; however, there are regional variations in fire activity and the projections do not consider changes in vegetation, ignitions, fire season length, and human activity, which may also impact area burned. [@flannigan-2005-future-area]  `degree: 81` `citations: 644`  
Future scenarios of climate change and global fire activity disruptions show less pronounced decreases, primarily in tropical and subtropical biomes, with major uncertainties in the direction of near-term changes across over 50% of terrestrial lands, but by the end of the century, there is projected to be a substantial increase in the magnitude and agreement in the direction of change, with most agreement on increasing fire probabilities occurring at mid-to high-latitudes and decreasing probabilities mainly in the tropics; however, further research is needed to assess the explanatory power of interannual variation in climate variables in capturing fire probability patterns and to evaluate fire-related vulnerabilities to humans and ecosystems. [@moritz-NA-climate-change]  `degree: 61` `citations: NA`  
The projected increase in continental runoff due to plant responses to increasing carbon dioxide concentration, also known as physiological forcing, has been detected in observational records of increasing average continental runoff over the twentieth century. Using a global climate model with a vegetation component, we find that the physiological effect of doubled carbon dioxide concentrations on plant transpiration leads to a 6% increase in simulated global mean runoff relative to pre-industrial levels, considering uncertainties in future precipitation. [@betts-2007-projected-increase]  `degree: 19` `citations: 504`  
Projected climate change in Russian and Canadian boreal forests will lead to larger areas of extreme fire danger, an earlier fire season, and increased fire activity, requiring a restructuring of forest fire management and a return to natural fire regimes. [@stocks-1998-climate-change]  `degree: 35` `citations: 500`  
Combining scientific and local knowledge to create and evaluate future forest scenarios improves the understanding of potential long-term effects of management practices on ecosystem services, highlighting the importance of considering both short- and long-term impacts. Stakeholders found that scenarios emphasizing biodiversity conservation and net present value promoted more ecosystem services, posed fewer climate risks, and generated less conflict among stakeholders, underscoring the value of integrating different forms of knowledge in scenario development and evaluation. [@hallberg-sramek-2023-combining-scientific]  `degree: 7` `citations: 1`  
High-resolution wildfire simulations reveal the complexity of climate change impacts on burn probability in Southern California, with considerable uncertainty in future changes and a demonstrated need to consider interactions between temperature, humidity, precipitation, and seasonality of energy release. Simple correlations of increasing fire with increasing temperature may underestimate the range of plausible future fire scenarios. [@dye-2023-high-resolution-wildfire]  `degree: 12` `citations: 0`  
Future fire carbon emissions are likely to decrease due to sustainable economic development, improved fire management, and capitalized agriculture, with the meteorological factor having a significant impact under higher warming cases, particularly in boreal forests, highlighting the need for climate change researchers to consider fire-carbon interactions and for the development of national mitigation and adaptation plans that incorporate future spatial changes under diverse scenarios. (48 words) [@park-2023-impact-climate]  `degree: 11` `citations: 0`  
Climate change is expected to impact boreal forest succession, disturbances, productivity, and mortality; using an ecophysiological-based mechanistic landscape model, we assessed the effects of climate change and wildfires on forest composition, biomass carbon storage, and mortality in three management units in Quebec boreal forest, finding a decrease in coniferous occupancy and an increase in mixed deciduous and coniferous forests, with overall biomass carbon stock potentially doubling under certain climate change scenarios. [@ameray-2023-climate-change]  `degree: 8` `citations: 0`  
Forest management has a greater impact on the future supply of boreal forest ecosystem services than climate change, with management effects being, on average, 11 times higher than climate change effects across all services, although the magnitude of these effects varies among services and biogeographical zones within the boreal biome, highlighting the need for region-specific guidelines for forest adaptation to global change.

#### Cluster 12: Climate Change and Air Quality
The common topic of the cluster is the impact of climate change on air quality, specifically regarding tropospheric ozone and aerosols. The texts discuss how climate change affects the concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter in the atmosphere, both globally and regionally, and how these changes are influenced by greenhouse gas emissions. They highlight the complex interactions between climate change, emissions, and meteorological factors, and emphasize the need to consider climate-induced changes when planning for future air quality standards. The cluster provides insights into the predicted increase in surface layer ozone concentrations, the role of regional climate change and emissions in air pollution, and the potential implications for human health and the environment. Therefore, the common topic of the cluster is "Climate Change and Air Quality."    
**Articles:**  
Climate change is expected to have complex effects on future tropospheric ozone and aerosol levels, with reductions in global ozone burden but increased surface layer ozone concentrations over populated and biomass burning areas, as well as changes in aerosol burdens due to altered emissions and thermodynamic equilibrium. [@liao-2006-role-climate]  `degree: 64` `citations: 198`  
Future scenarios of regional air pollution over the eastern United States were simulated using a modeling system that incorporated climate change, emissions, and atmospheric composition. The results showed that changes in regional climate and boundary conditions had the largest impact on ozone concentrations, followed by increased anthropogenic emissions. These findings emphasize the importance of considering climate change when planning for future air quality standards. [@hogrefe-2004-simulating-changes]  `degree: 61` `citations: 202`  
Future scenarios of global climate change and emissions reveal a potential decrease in regional ozone and fine particulate matter concentrations over the United States, with reductions of more than 50% in NOX and SO2 emissions, leading to a 20% decrease in mean summer maximum daily 8-hour ozone levels and an estimated 23% lower mean annual PM2.5 concentrations, particularly benefiting the eastern United States and urban sites like Atlanta. [@tagaris-2007-impacts-global]  `degree: 59` `citations: 155`  
Future scenarios of climate change in the United States are predicted to result in a decrease in background ozone levels, but an increase in ozone produced internally, particularly in the eastern region, leading to up to 12 additional days per year exceeding the maximum daily 8-hour averaged ozone limit of 80 ppbv. Various climatic factors, such as temperature, water vapor, clouds, transport, and lightning NOx, are identified as influencing the net increase in ozone. [@murazaki-2006-how-does]  `degree: 64` `citations: 156`  
We present greenhouse gas concentrations for the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and their extensions beyond 2100, known as the Extended Concentration Pathways (ECPs), which include major anthropogenic greenhouse gases and are the result of a multi-year effort to produce new scenarios for climate change research. The projected global-mean surface temperature increases range from 1.5 degrees C by 2100 for the lowest RCP (RCP2.6) to 4.5 degrees C for the highest one (RCP8.5), relative to pre-industrial levels. We also provide the GHG concentrations for supplementary extensions, illustrating the emissions implications of different scenarios. [@meinshausen-2011-rcp-greenhouse]  `degree: 94` `citations: 2444`  
Observational and reanalysis data have shown a significant trend towards the positive phase of the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM), indicating a major shift in the broadscale climate of the Southern Hemisphere; however, previous studies using NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data have been compromised by spurious negative trends and errors in SH high-latitude pressure, highlighting the need for a reliable benchmark against which future climate scenarios can be evaluated; this study addresses this issue by employing an empirical definition of the SAM and station data, revealing a statistically significant increase in the difference in zonal mean sea level pressure between 40°S and 65°S, with the trend being most pronounced since the mid-1970s; however, it is also shown that trends in the SAM and zonal mean sea level pressure difference are exaggerated in the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data, while equivalent data from the ECMWF ERA-40 reanalysis provides a more accurate representation of SH high-latitude atmospheric circulation variability, making it ideal for examining the recent trend in the SAM.

We developed the Regional Emission inventory in ASia (REAS) Version 1.1, the first emission inventory to integrate historical, present, and future emissions in Asia using a consistent methodology, and found that total energy consumption in Asia more than doubled between 1980 and 2003, leading to significant increases in emissions of air pollutants, particularly in China, with emissions of SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, black carbon ( BC), and organic carbon (OC) showing large temporal variations from 1980-2003 and projected to increase substantially by 2020, depending on different emission scenarios. [@ohara-2007-asian-emission]  `degree: 30` `citations: 1222`  
This paper provides the 2005 global inventory of anthropogenic mercury emissions and describes the methodology used to compile emissions data as well as the results. It also presents initial findings on scenario emissions inventories for 2020 to assess the potential impact of global mercury emission reduction efforts.

A comprehensive evaluation of nitrogen and sulfur deposition across the globe reveals that models generally agree with observations in Europe and North America, but overestimate NHx deposition in South Asia and underestimate NOy deposition in East Asia. Variability in removal mechanisms leads to significant differences in deposition fluxes, particularly in anthropogenic emission regions. Currently, a substantial percentage of deposition occurs over the ocean, while natural vegetation receives the majority of land-based deposition. Approximately 11% of global natural vegetation exceeds the critical load threshold for nitrogen deposition. Future deposition fluxes will be primarily driven by changes in emissions, with Europe and Asia being the most affected regions. [@dentener-2006-nitrogen-and]  `degree: 29` `citations: 762`  
Future scenarios of substantial short- and long-term health effects due to PM2.5 and its constituents in China are explored, showing that even with emission reductions, premature deaths are projected to increase due to aging offsetting air quality improvements, with organic carbon identified as the major contributor to short-term exposure deaths and compound events of high relative humidity and atmospheric stagnation found to have a larger impact on premature deaths compared to individual events, emphasizing the importance of considering both long- and short-term health effects and extreme weather events. [@xiang-2023-substantial-short-]  `degree: 8` `citations: 0`  
Future scenarios of ozone-related mortality in China over the period 2013-2030 show that changes in ozone concentration, population age structure, population size, and mortality rate for respiratory disease will contribute to varying rates of O3-mortality; while the deterioration of ozone air quality is identified as the primary factor contributing to the rise in O3-mortality from 2013-2019, population aging alone is projected to result in significant increases in O3-mortality in the coming decade, surpassing the impact of ozone air quality deterioration. [@chen-2023-increases-ozone-related]  `degree: 8` `citations: 0`  
This study explores the impacts of technology-driven climate and emission changes on future meteorology and air quality in the U.S. Using a Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry simulations, two climate scenarios (A1B and B2) and emissions from a Technology Driver Model are integrated. The results show widespread reductions in gas and aerosol species emissions, but an increase in maximum daily average 8-hour ozone levels due to temperature increases and methane concentrations. However, under the B2 scenario, ozone levels decrease except near urban centers. The study also finds that both climate and emission changes lead to decreases in daily average PM2.5 concentrations, particularly in the eastern U.S., suggesting potential improvements in future air quality.

Future scenarios of climate-driven deterioration of ozone pollution in Asia are predicted using machine learning and multi-source data, with projected increases in near-surface ozone concentrations over South China, Southeast Asia, and South India, and expansion of summertime ozone pollution over eastern China. These findings highlight the significance of climate change penalties on Asian ozone pollution and provide implications for environmental and climate strategies. [@li-2023-climate-driven-deterioration]  `degree: 9` `citations: 0`  
Simulated future air quality scenarios in Korea, based on different emission control pathways, indicate reductions in NO2, SO2, and PM2.5 concentrations, as well as a decrease in O3 levels under SSP1 (most sustainable pathway) in the long-term. However, under SSP3 (most challenging pathway), O3 concentrations increase due to elevated CH4 levels and biogenic VOC emissions. While overall PM2.5 concentrations decrease, the contribution of biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) to PM2.5 is projected to increase. Estimating cardiorespiratory mortality changes, we find that the total excess mortality due to air pollutants decreases under SSP1 but increases by 80% in 2045 and decreases by 22% in 2095 under SSP3, highlighting the significant health implications of different emission scenarios. Additionally, the regional variability of BSOA contribution emphasizes the potential local health impact of BSOA in the future. [@oak-2023-future-air]  `degree: 10` `citations: 0`

#### Cluster 13: Climate Extremes and Future Projections
The main topic of the cluster is climate extremes and their projections in future climate scenarios. The texts discuss the changes in temperature and precipitation extremes, including heat waves, heavy rainfall, and dry conditions. They analyze the impacts of climate change on these extremes on a global and regional scale. The texts also mention the use of climate models to simulate and project these changes. Overall, the common topic of the cluster is the assessment and analysis of future climate extremes and their implications.    
**Articles:**  
This study examines future climate projections of climate extremes indices using the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, finding that changes in indices based on daily minimum temperatures are more pronounced than those based on daily maximum temperatures, and that extreme precipitation generally increases faster than total wet-day precipitation. Changes in temperature and precipitation indices are most significant under RCP8.5, exceeding previous studies based on SRES scenarios. The complete set of indices is available for further research.

Future greenhouse warming is predicted to lead to more frequent El Nino events and stronger cold events in the tropical Pacific Ocean, according to a global climate model with sufficient resolution in the tropics to adequately represent the narrow equatorial upwelling and low-frequency waves. [@timmermann-1999-increased-el]  `degree: 28` `citations: 980`  
Future scenarios of climate extremes were analyzed using global general circulation models (GCMs) and historical and future simulations of temperature and precipitation indicators. The consensus from the GCM ensemble indicates greater temperature extremes and a wetter world, but with less certainty when considering regional patterns. These findings have important implications for climate projections and impact assessments. (47 words) [@tebaldi-2006-going-the]  `degree: 73` `citations: 883`  
This study evaluates temperature and precipitation extremes in global climate models participating in the IPCC diagnostic exercise for the Fourth Assessment Report. The models simulate present-day warm extremes well, but struggle with cold extremes, particularly in sea ice-covered areas. Precipitation extremes are plausible in the extratropics, but uncertainties remain in the Tropics. Changes in warm extremes follow mean summertime temperature changes, with cold extremes warming faster. The intensity of precipitation extremes generally exceeds changes in mean precipitation, leading to reduced waiting times for extreme events. The consensus among models is that 20-year return values of annual extremes of 24-hour precipitation amounts will increase by about 6% with each kelvin of global warming. However, large intermodel disagreements in the Tropics reduce confidence in these projections. [@kharin-2007-changes-temperature]  `degree: 63` `citations: 792`  
This study evaluates changes in temperature and precipitation extremes in an ensemble of climate models participating in the CMIP5 project, documenting projected changes for three radiative forcing scenarios. The models perform comparably to the CMIP3 ensemble in simulating 20-year temperature and precipitation extremes, with better agreement for warm extremes. However, uncertainties remain in simulating extreme precipitation in the tropics and subtropics. Cold extremes warm faster than warm extremes, particularly in regions affected by snow and sea-ice retreat. Intensity of precipitation extremes generally increases more than annual mean precipitation, resulting in reduced waiting times for extreme events. The CMIP5 planetary sensitivity in extreme precipitation is approximately 6% per degree Celsius, with lower values over extratropical land. [@kharin-2013-changes-temperature]  `degree: 67` `citations: 757`  
Future climate change over East Asia, as assessed using the RCP scenarios downscaled by GRIMs-RMP, indicates strong warming coupled with intensified monsoonal precipitation, with extreme weather conditions projected to increase and intensify over South Korea, including a significant increase in the frequency of heat wave events and an increase in the frequency and variability of heavy rainfall.

Investigating the nonstationary association of monsoon temperature and precipitation extremes in East-Central India, this study finds that the nonstationarity of precipitation extremes is becoming more pronounced under anthropogenic warming. The generalized extreme value distribution is used to model the trend in parameters of the distribution, with local temperature categories as covariates. The results show significant trends in precipitation frequency and intensity over certain regions, with high uncertainty in estimated quantiles over the Himalayan territory. The study also predicts average design return values for different return periods in various regions. [@biswas-2023-investigation-nonstationary]  `degree: 11` `citations: 1`  
This study investigates future scenarios of drying in subtropical East Asia during winter and identifies the mechanism behind it. It finds that the weakening of the southern branch westerly jet on the southern side of the Tibetan Plateau plays a crucial role in suppressing precipitation in the region. The study also highlights that the models underestimate the sensitivity of precipitation to interannual variability in the jet stream. By considering observational constraints, the projected drying trend is amplified, showing a decrease in precipitation of 3.3% per degree of warming, with greater reductions in southern China.

Policymakers must address these projections to effectively plan for future healthcare needs and costs. [@boyle-2010-projection-the]  `degree: 7` `citations: 902`  
Relaxing current restrictions on nicotine vaping products in Australia could lead to significant public health gains, according to a modeling study. The study found that under a permissive scenario, assuming an NVP excess risk of 5% that of smoking, over 100 thousand smoking-attributable deaths and 2 million life years lost could be averted between 2017 and 2080. The impact is most sensitive to the rate at which smokers switch to vaping and quit smoking. However, more research is needed to better understand the impact of NVPs on smoking if access regulations were relaxed. The study highlights the potential benefits of maintaining cigarette-oriented policies while relaxing current NVP restrictions in Australia.

This analysis investigates the impact of future climate scenarios on the energy use of commercial buildings in the United States, using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios defined in the IPCC Assessment Report 5. The study finds that, if US commercial floorspace remained constant, total energy use by 2100 is predicted to decrease by 1.75% under the highest emission scenario (8.5) and increase by 1.76% under the lowest emission scenario (2.6). Adjusted for anticipated urban growth, the predicted range is a 65% increase (8.5) to a 71% increase (2.6). Furthermore, the warmest climate zones in the US will experience significant increases in electricity use for cooling, while the coldest climate zones will see decreases in natural gas use for heating. Ultimately, climate change is projected to be a net energy saver for the United States from a building energy perspective. [@bass-2023-how-will]  `degree: 11` `citations: 2`

#### Cluster 19: Effects of environmental changes on plant and soil ecosystems
The common topic across the texts in this cluster is the impact of environmental factors, such as nitrogen addition, increased precipitation, warming, and drought, on plant and soil ecosystems. These studies investigate the responses of plant communities, microbial communities, soil respiration, and soil organic carbon to these environmental changes. The findings highlight the importance of water availability, species traits, soil acidity, and nutrient availability in shaping plant and soil communities under changing environmental conditions. The studies also emphasize the need to consider the differential responses of ecosystem components and the functionality of the soil organic carbon pool when predicting the effects of future climate change. Therefore, the common topic of this cluster is the effects of environmental changes on plant and soil ecosystems.    
**Articles:**  
Increased nitrogen (N) enrichment and precipitation are expected to impact plant communities, influencing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. A study in a temperate steppe in northern China found that increased precipitation and N addition had contrasting effects on species richness. Plant community structure and composition were significantly altered by these treatments, with soil moisture and species traits playing important roles. Understanding these factors will be crucial for predicting vegetation dynamics in response to future environmental changes. [@yang-2011-plant-community]  `degree: 17` `citations: 272`  
Future scenarios of warming and drought in grassland ecosystems are likely to have significant effects on microbial communities, including changes in population size, diversity, and composition, with warming treatments generally increasing population size and decreasing diversity, but drought conditions leading to a reduction in population size and changes in species richness, diversity, and evenness. [@sheik-2011-effect-warming]  `degree: 6` `citations: 246`  
Soil acidification plays a larger role in controlling soil respiration than soil nitrogen availability in grasslands that are subjected to long-term nitrogen enrichment, highlighting the need to consider N-induced soil acidification when predicting the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in future scenarios of nitrogen deposition. [@chen-2016-soil-acidification]  `degree: 14` `citations: 147`  
Warming significantly increased above-ground plant respiration and total autotrophic plant respiration, but reduced heterotrophic respiration in a meadow grassland on the Tibetan Plateau, resulting in insensitive responses of ecosystem respiration and soil respiration to warming. These findings suggest that future carbon-climate feedbacks should consider the differential responses of ecosystem respiration components under warming scenarios. [@chen-2016-differential-responses]  `degree: 12` `citations: 128`  
Nitrogen enrichment increases particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) pools in soil, but decreases the ratios of MAOC to SOC and MAOC to POC. Increases in POC are correlated with aboveground plant biomass and hydrolytic enzymes, while increases in MAOC are linked to microbial biomass. These findings suggest that while nitrogen deposition can enhance soil carbon sequestration, it may also reduce nutrient density, turnover time, and resistance to disturbance in the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Understanding these effects is crucial for predicting SOC dynamics in future scenarios with more frequent and severe disturbances. [@tang-2023-nitrogen-increases]  `degree: 3` `citations: 4`  
The Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC), a significant event in the geological history of the Mediterranean, continues to captivate the scientific community. Recent advancements have led to the development of a comprehensive stratigraphic framework, which incorporates onshore and offshore data, and allows for testing through deep drilling. This ecological crisis, driven by geodynamic and climatic factors, had a profound impact on the Mediterranean's geological history and global ocean salinity. The MSC unfolded in three distinct stages, each marked by unique palaeoenvironmental conditions. [@roveri-2014-messinian-salinity]  `degree: 3` `citations: 384`  
This meta-analysis examines the effects of nitrogen fertilization on soil extracellular enzyme activities and carbon and nitrogen storage. The study finds that nitrogen fertilization increases certain enzyme activities but decreases others, and also has differential effects on soil carbon, nitrogen, and microbial biomass. The authors suggest that the observed relationship between enzyme activities and microbial biomass could be used as a proxy for carbon acquisition in future models of global nitrogen enrichment scenarios. [@jian-2016-soil-extracellular]  `degree: 2` `citations: 396`  
Increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lead to higher activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), resulting in significant loss of soil carbon, challenging the notion that AMF protect against organic carbon degradation and raising concerns about future carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems. [@cheng-2012-arbuscular-mycorrhizal]  `degree: 14` `citations: 382`  
Future scenarios of more extreme and frequent drought events in semiarid grasslands may lead to large reductions in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and perennial forb biomass, but our study found that ANPP fully recovered within 1 year after the drought treatments were terminated, primarily due to increased soil total nitrogen and root biomass allocation after drought. Surprisingly, the extreme drought treatment led to overcompensation, with large increases in ANPP during the recovery periods compared to the control, driven by the enhanced biomass of perennial grasses. This highlights the rapid recovery of grasslands and the critical role of community overcompensation in maintaining ecosystem function and stability under future climate change scenarios. [@ru-2023-overcompensation-ecosystem]  `degree: 2` `citations: 1`  
Moderate precipitation reduction in a semi-arid grassland enhances plant root turnover and soil nitrogen (N)-cycling processes, leading to increased emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) after each rainfall event, primarily through nitrification processes, according to field experiments and lab incubation studies. These findings suggest that future precipitation scenarios with altered drying-rewetting cycles may intensify N cycling and soil N2O emissions in semi-arid ecosystems, contributing to climate change. [@zhang-2023-moderate-precipitation]  `degree: 4` `citations: 0`  
Warming does not have a significant effect on soil carbon stock, but it does increase root biomass and soil respiration, with the effects depending on soil nitrogen availability; soil C:N ratio plays a critical role in mediating warming effects on soil carbon dynamics, which should be considered in future global warming scenarios.

Based on these common themes, the common topic shared by the articles is "The Impact of Soil Erosion on Food Security and Sustainable Agriculture."    
**Articles:**  
Soil degradation and land scarcity present a complex challenge to food security, as they reduce yield and may lead to soil abandonment; yet, the importance of preserving soil health is often overlooked by policy makers. In this paper, we review the typologies and global estimates of soil degradation, discuss the interwoven issues of agricultural production, natural resources, and land use, and analyze scenarios for the availability of arable land. We argue for a precautionary approach given the uncertainties and risks involved, and emphasize the need for sustainable agricultural practices and a reconsideration of our relationship with nature and resources. [@gomiero-2016-soil-degradation]  `degree: 2` `citations: 209`  
This study addresses the limitations in previous soil erosion models by considering both direct impacts of climate change, such as increased rainfall intensity, and indirect impacts, such as changes in land use and management.

Using a GIS-based RUSLE model, this research provides the first comprehensive assessment of global soil erosion potential, considering historical, present, and future conditions of cropland and climate; results indicate that present soil erosion potential is estimated at 0.38 mm/year globally, with Southeast Asia being the most affected region, and human activity accounting for nearly 60% of erosion, while global warming may significantly increase erosion potential, particularly in regions experiencing increased precipitation and population. [@yang-2003-global-potential]  `degree: 37` `citations: 438`  
We quantitatively assess the global abundance and functional group composition of soil nematodes, the most abundant animals on Earth, using georeferenced samples. Our high-resolution models reveal that nematodes are present in large numbers across the globe, with higher abundances in sub-Arctic regions. These models provide valuable insights into soil fertility and functioning, and can be used to predict elemental cycling under current and future climate scenarios.

This study examines the future scenarios of soil erosion in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area in China, taking into account both global climate change and regional vegetation restoration projects. The results suggest that while overall soil erosion is projected to decrease, different calculation methods for erosion factors can lead to different trends, with some indicating a significant increase in erosion. The study also highlights the effectiveness of the grain-for-green policy in reducing soil erosion, particularly in scenarios with higher forest cover. Additionally, the increasing precipitation in all scenarios emphasizes the need for continued efforts to control soil loss in the TGR area.

This study predicts soil erosion potential in the Chini Lake Basin, Malaysia under different CMIP6 climate change scenarios. The results show that future soil erosion values are influenced by different scenarios, with the highest values projected for SSP4.5 and the lowest values for SSP2.6. Overall, the study suggests a reduction of approximately 33.9% in future soil erosion potential compared to the baseline year. The rainfall erosivity factor has a significant impact on soil erosion potential in the study area. These findings contribute to the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. [@rendana-2023-predicting-soil]  `degree: 7` `citations: 0`  
Projected mid-century rainfall erosivity is expected to increase by 47%, with the greatest absolute increase in coastal and mountainous regions, suggesting that changes in rainfall intensity, rather than precipitation amount, are driving the change in erosivity in the southeastern United States under climate change. [@takhellambam-2023-projected-mid-century]  `degree: 6` `citations: 0`  
This study compares two weather generator-based tools for simulating storm intensification and its impacts on soil erosion under climate change, finding that both tools are capable of providing information on future storm intensification, and that they can be used to generate a range of potential impacts on soil erosion and surface hydrology.

#### Cluster 21: The Cognitive Processes and Neural Mechanisms of Mental Time Travel and Future Thinking
The common topic of the cluster is the cognitive processes involved in mental time travel, episodic memory, and future thinking. The articles discuss the mechanisms and neural substrates that allow humans to mentally travel in time, simulate future scenarios, and imagine hypothetical events. They explore how these cognitive processes are linked to memory, decision-making, risk-taking behavior, and entrepreneurial thinking. The cluster highlights the importance of cognitive flexibility and the ability to consider future outcomes in shaping human behavior. Therefore, the common topic can be framed as "The Cognitive Processes and Neural Mechanisms of Mental Time Travel and Future Thinking."    
**Articles:**  
This article discusses the mechanisms of mental time travel, which allows humans to envision potential future scenarios and make decisions accordingly. The authors propose the use of future-oriented action methodologies to study mental time travel in children, as linguistic performance alone may be misleading. They also suggest an experimental paradigm to assess mental time travel in nonhuman animals, and describe a preliminary study using this paradigm for children. (46 words) [@suddendorf-2005-making-decisions]  `degree: 19` `citations: 263`  
The cognitive neuroscience of constructive memory focuses on the idea that memory is a constructive process prone to errors and illusions, and recent studies suggest that memory distortions serve adaptive functions. One key function is the ability to simulate or imagine future scenarios by drawing on past experiences, as evidenced by overlapping psychological and neural processes involved in remembering the past and imagining the future. [@schacter-2007-cognitive-neuroscience]  `degree: 51` `citations: 1052`  
This study found that people tend to underestimate their own task completion times, but not others', and that they focus on future scenarios rather than past experiences when making predictions. Participants' predictions were overly optimistic, but when instructed to consider relevant past experiences, this bias was eliminated. Additionally, participants attributed their past prediction failures to external, transient, and specific factors. Observer participants, on the other hand, overestimated others' completion times and relied more on past experiences. [@buehler-1994-exploring-planning]  `degree: 11` `citations: 592`  
The study investigates the neural mechanisms involved in envisioning the future and suggests that similarities between future and past tasks arise from the reactivation of previously experienced visual-spatial contexts, shedding light on the cognitive ability of projecting oneself in the future. [@szpunar-2007-neural-substrates]  `degree: 28` `citations: 537`  
Using cognitive theory to explain entrepreneurial risk-taking, this study found that entrepreneurs categorize equivocal business scenarios more positively than non-entrepreneurs, leading them to view these situations as opportunities rather than risky ventures with low returns. This suggests that cognitive processes, unlike personal traits, can be changed, offering hope for identifying and exploiting business opportunities and potentially developing a taxonomy to differentiate entrepreneurs from small business owners. [@palich-1995-using-cognitive]  `degree: 2` `citations: 496`  
This article explores the concept of episodic future thought, which involves mentally simulating hypothetical scenarios that may occur in the future. It discusses the relationship between episodic future thought and the ability to remember personal episodes from one's past, and suggests that both episodic and semantic memory contribute to the construction of episodic future thoughts. The role of abstracted representations in this process is also discussed. [@szpunar-2010-episodic-future]  `degree: 27` `citations: 438`  
Age-related decline in episodic specificity of past events has been well-documented, but it remains unclear if this decline also applies to the simulation of future events. In a study using an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview, older adults were found to generate fewer internal details (episodic) than younger adults when generating both past and future events, replicating previous findings on age-related changes in episodic memory. [@addis-2008-age-related-changes]  `degree: 26` `citations: 432`  
A randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the effectiveness of an online cognitive-bias-modification program in training individuals to have more positive episodic predictions. The results showed that participants in the positive-training condition demonstrated improvements in negative and positive expectancy bias, as well as self-efficacy. These gains were maintained at a 1-month follow-up. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in anxiety and depression symptoms or growth mindset between the different conditions. This study highlights the potential of scalable programs to target and improve cognitive biases and outlook. [@eberle-2023-shifting-episodic]  `degree: 1` `citations: 0`  
This study investigates the interplay between risk-taking propensity, physiological markers of emotion, and performance in a game scenario that simulates decision-making in an ambiguous environment, finding that entrepreneurs' risk-taking propensity impedes emotion-based learning, leading to worse performances on the Iowa gambling task compared to the control group. [@seloni-2023-perils-acting]  `degree: 1` `citations: 0`  
In this study, the researchers investigated the relationship between mental imagery content and disease severity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). They found that the quality of visual imagery (VI) content during daily practice was related to functional connectivity changes in brain areas supporting visuospatial and sensorimotor processes. Additionally, subjects with worse disease severity showed poorer quality of VI content. These findings suggest that mental imagery training combining VI and motor imagery (MI) may enhance motor function in patients with mild PD, highlighting the importance of incorporating self-reports of thoughts and experiences in neuroimaging studies of complex cognitive processes in neuropsychiatric patient populations. [@cherry-2023-mental-imagery]  `degree: 2` `citations: 0`  
Verbal explanations and item choices in children's episodic foresight tasks were examined to determine the extent to which future projection, memory, or semantic associations are required for success. Results showed that children's explanations were more future-oriented and included more personal pronouns in the Picture-book task compared to the Spoon task, indicating a higher level of future orientation and self-projection. Age and item choice were significant predictors of future orientation and episodicity in the Picture-book task, while item choice significantly predicted future orientation and episodicity in the Spoon task. This study demonstrates the importance of verbal explanations in understanding the underlying processes of episodic foresight. [@mazachowsky-2023-verbal-explanations]  `degree: 3` `citations: 0`  
This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and other representation methods in projecting oneself into a future office space and its influence on willingness to relocate. Participants were assigned to different representation conditions (VR, desktop, and paper) and were instructed to freely explore their representation method. The results indicate that VR significantly differed in terms of presence, user experience, and engagement compared to other methods. Users in VR spent more time exploring the environment and provided more positive comments about the building. Overall, VR enhanced users' capability to imagine future scenarios, supported them in projecting themselves into these spaces, and positively affected their attitude towards relocating.

#### Cluster 22: Mathematical modeling and assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19.
The common topic in this cluster of texts is the mathematical modeling and assessment of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic. The texts discuss the use of social distancing, mask-wearing, and other interventions as strategies for controlling and mitigating the spread of the virus. They also highlight the importance of vaccination and the effectiveness of different intervention scenarios in reducing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Mathematical models are used to analyze the population-level impact of these interventions and to make projections for the future trajectory of the pandemic. Overall, the texts focus on the quantitative assessment and modeling of various strategies to combat COVID-19.    
**Articles:**  
A mathematical model was developed to assess the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. The model showed that maintaining strict social-distancing measures until the end of May or June could significantly reduce the worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality. The study also emphasized the importance of social-distancing and the use of face-masks, with higher adherence levels resulting in a dramatic reduction in the burden of the pandemic. Combining low efficacy masks with other intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. [@ngonghala-NA-mathematical-assessment]  `degree: 8` `citations: NA`  
Future scenarios for COVID-19 dynamics in the UK were predicted using a mathematical model that incorporated vaccination rollout and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The study found that vaccination alone is insufficient to control the outbreak, and even with optimistic assumptions, the reproduction number (R) is estimated to be 1.58 once all eligible adults have been vaccinated. Removing all NPIs after vaccination is predicted to result in a significant number of deaths, emphasizing the importance of continued NPIs alongside vaccination. [@moore-2021-vaccination-and]  `degree: 17` `citations: 258`  
Modeling future scenarios of COVID-19 in the United States based on case and mortality data, a SEIR model predicts that cumulative deaths could reach 511,373 by February 2021 if current intervention strategies continue. However, achieving universal mask use could potentially save an additional 129,574 lives, or 95,814 lives with a lesser adoption of mask wearing, mitigating the effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. [@reiner-2021-modeling-covid-19]  `degree: 7` `citations: 223`  
Short-term forecasting models, including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning, were evaluated for predicting COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states. SVR and stacking-ensemble learning demonstrated better performance, achieving accurate forecasting with errors ranging from 0.87% to 6.90% in different time horizons. These models can assist decision-making in managing the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases. (43 words) [@ribeiro-2020-short-term-forecasting]  `degree: 3` `citations: 215`  
Assessing the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 is crucial for future preparedness plans.

Overall, the cluster focuses on understanding and improving the management of water resources in urban areas, considering factors such as population growth, climate change, and the efficient utilization of rainfall.    
**Articles:**  
This paper reviews the methodological advances in urban water demand modeling, within the framework of coupled human and natural systems, focusing on four central themes: spatial and temporal scales, uncertainty, system response, and the transition to dynamic modeling. The review concludes that technological and statistical innovations have led to increasingly effective models that provide accurate estimates of urban water demand determinants at fine resolution, with a trend towards incorporating alternative future scenarios and stochastic analysis.

This literature review examines urban water demand forecasting from 2000 to 2010, highlighting the range of methods and models utilized for decision making in water utilities. The study emphasizes the importance of tailoring the choice of model based on the forecast variable, periodicity, and horizon. Short-term forecasting commonly utilizes artificial neural networks, while long-term strategic decisions often rely on econometric models coupled with simulation or scenario-based forecasting. However, future research should prioritize the development of probabilistic forecasting methods to account for uncertainty in demand forecasts. [@donkor-2014-urban-water]  `degree: 13` `citations: 243`  
This paper investigates the potential benefits of using uncertainty predictions in seasonal inflow volumes for improved reservoir release decisions, highlighting the complex dependence of optimal release and objective function on reservoir parameters and uncertain inflow forcing. The study finds that predicted inflow uncertainty is particularly beneficial when operating near reservoir capacity or near zero reservoir volume, but errors in predicted uncertainty can lead to suboptimal release decisions and significant operation losses. The presence of binding release constraints also hinders the benefits of uncertainty predictions, suggesting the need for less rigid release policies. The study further identifies the reservoir capacity values that are most sensitive to seasonal inflow uncertainty predictions. Suggestions for further research in this area are provided.

#### Cluster 25: Acid Deposition and Drought-Induced Acidification
The main topic of this cluster is the impact of acid deposition and drought-induced acidification on soil and water chemistry in different ecosystems. The texts discuss the relationship between nitrogen input and nitrate leaching in European forests, the importance of base cation deposition in mitigating acid rain and acidification in China, the mobility of dissolved organic carbon in peat soils under drought conditions, changes in acidification of lochs in Scotland over time, and the sensitivity of soil calcium supply and stream acid neutralizing capacity to whole-tree harvest. The texts also mention the modelling of future impacts of biomass harvesting and climate change on acid-sensitive catchments in Finland, as well as the prediction of metal release from peat due to drought-induced acidification. Therefore, the common topic of these texts is the understanding and prediction of the effects of acid deposition and drought-induced acidification on soil and water chemistry in various ecosystems.    
**Articles:**  
The study analyzes the IFEF database to evaluate the relationship between nitrogen input and nitrate leaching in European forests, finding that nitrate leaching is strongly dependent on nitrogen deposition and that the C/N ratio in the organic horizon can be used as an indicator of nitrate leaching, particularly when stratified based on C/N ratios.

Acid rain and acidification in China are major environmental concerns, with previous studies primarily focusing on sulfur deposition and precipitation pH. However, the presence of high concentrations of alkaline dust in many parts of China necessitates consideration of base cation deposition to understand its effects on soil and vegetation. By analyzing both measured and modeled data, we estimate the regional deposition of sulfur and calcium, the dominant anion and cation, respectively, in China. The ratio of sulfur to calcium deposition serves as an indicator of areas where deposition acidity exceeds alkalinity, posing a risk of soil acidification. Using the MAGIC model, we demonstrate significant soil acidification over the past few decades due to acid deposition in two highly impacted sites in southwest China. We also illustrate the potential effects of different future deposition scenarios on the spatial distribution of acidic deposition in China. Considering that the anthropogenic fraction of base cation deposition remains uncertain, we explore various possible trends in calcium deposition. Model predictions reveal the soil response under different combinations of sulfur and calcium deposition scenarios. Notably, implementing stringent measures to reduce sulfur emissions can effectively address the acid deposition problem. [@larssen-2000-acid-rain]  `degree: 4` `citations: 294`  
Future scenarios suggest that drought-induced acidification can significantly affect the mobility of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in peat soils, as demonstrated by a 10-year time series analysis. Drought conditions were found to have a strong relationship with DOC and sulphate dynamics, resulting in lower DOC concentrations due to drought-induced acidification. This finding has implications for understanding the impact of climate change on DOC suppression in soil and stream waters during drought events. [@clark-2005-influence-drought-induced]  `degree: 4` `citations: 229`  
Decreased acidic deposition in the Galloway area of Scotland from 1979 to 1988 resulted in changes in water chemistry, as demonstrated by a survey of 50 lochs. The MAGIC model successfully reproduced these changes and can be used to evaluate the future impact of acidic deposition and afforestation on fish status in the region. Afforestation was found to further acidify the lochs if acidic deposition remained at 1988 levels. Acidic deposition was identified as the main cause of soil and water acidification, with forestry practices exacerbating the effects.  [@wright-1994-changes-acidification]  `degree: 13` `citations: 47`  
This study modeled the long-term effects of whole-tree harvest on soil and stream water acidity in Swedish forested catchments using the MAGIC model, finding that all three sites experienced large depletions in soil calcium supply and a reversal of the positive trend in stream acid neutralizing capacity, with the largest decrease in acid neutralizing capacity observed at the well-buffered site, Gammtratten, and the effects at Kindla and Aneboda being more limited and not large enough to offset the general recovery from acidification; sensitivity analyses showed that varying tree biomass calcium concentrations had the largest impact on the modelled outcomes, followed by site productivity, while changing biomass amounts left on site only marginally affected the results, and the reliability of the modelled outcomes could be improved by using site-specific calcium concentrations in tree biomass and field-determined identification of site productivity. [@zetterberg-2014-sensitivity-analyses]  `degree: 11` `citations: 26`  
The study found that while reductions in atmospheric deposition and biomass harvesting improved soil and lake water chemistry in acid-sensitive catchments in Finland, further reductions are still needed. The "MFR" scenario predicted long-term improvement in soil base saturation and continued recovery in surface waters, while the "WTH" scenario predicted re-acidification and negative impacts on soil and surface water chemistry. Increased utilization of biofuels will require balancing emissions with soil amendment to maintain ecosystem quality and sustainable forest growth. The current practice of sustainable maximum harvesting (SOH) is close to the limit for current atmospheric deposition in Finland. [@aherne-2008-modelling-hydro-geochemistry]  `degree: 20` `citations: 24`  
The study used the MAGIC model to predict the response of Finnish lake catchments to future acidic deposition and climatic change scenarios, based on European emission reduction policies and maximum feasible reductions, as well as climate projections from two global scenarios (IPCC A2 and B2). The study also examined the potential influence of changes in surface water organic carbon concentrations. Surprisingly, the results showed that current emission reduction policies have limited impact on future recovery. [@posch-2008-modelling-impacts]  `degree: 17` `citations: 15`  
Drought-induced acidification of ombrotrophic peat in northern England and Scotland, caused by the conversion of reduced peat sulfur to sulfuric acid, is predicted to lower soil solution pH and release potentially toxic metals. Simulation modeling suggests that pH decreases and increases in dissolved metal concentrations will occur during rewetting periods following droughts, with the severity of pH depressions declining gradually due to slow depletion of the soil sulfur pool but heavy metal pulses declining rapidly due to insufficient metal deposition to compensate for leaching losses.

The decline in nitrogen (N) deposition across Europe has led to decreased N inputs in forest ecosystems, particularly in Central and Western Europe with high deposition levels. Observational studies on various indicators such as soil acidification, understory vegetation, tree nutrition, vitality, and growth show varied ecosystem responses to decreasing N deposition. Experimental studies suggest that soil solution and foliar element concentrations are more responsive to changes in N supply compared to other parameters. While further decrease in N deposition is expected to be limited, future changes may be influenced by climate change and forest management's impact on N pools accumulated in forest soils. [@schmitz-2019-responses-forest]  `degree: 3` `citations: 98`  
Damming and climate change are impacting the patterns of water and material export from boreal rivers to the Eastern James Bay, with the peak discharge shifting to winter for the dammed river La Grande due to high energy demands and overall, the James Bay being a hot spot of DOC loading to the entire Hudson Bay System. [@de-2022-patterns-riverine]  `degree: 2` `citations: 1`  
Future scenarios of forest biomass removal in Finland show that stem-only or stem-and-branches harvesting is sustainable and does not deplete soil nutrient pools, while the most intensive scenario of whole-tree harvesting doubles biomass removal, triples base cation removal, and increases nitrogen removal fourfold, but climate change is predicted to have a positive impact by increasing base cation supply through weathering, although additional nitrogen and potassium inputs will be necessary for sustained forest growth under intensive biomass harvesting. [@aherne-2012-impacts-forest]  `degree: 13` `citations: 66`  
Future scenarios of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers lead to higher concentrations of halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in drinking water, specifically bromide and iodide, which are cyto- and genotoxic to mammalian cells and probable human carcinogens, resulting in increased risks of cancer and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) loss; further research is needed to understand the toxicity of other DBPs and predict cancer risks more accurately.

This study aimed to develop optimal management strategies to mitigate soil acidification and minimize nutrient losses in croplands by assessing the impacts of different nutrient management scenarios on soil pH and nutrient budgets. The results showed that replacing 70% of nitrogen fertilizer input with manure effectively neutralized acidity production and maintaining the soil pH. Additionally, balancing nitrogen and phosphorus input with crop demand significantly reduced nutrient surplus, while substituting nitrogen fertilizer with manure counteracted acidification. An optimized combination of fertilizer, manure, and lime was identified to minimize acidification and unnecessary phosphorus accumulation. The VSD+ model was deemed a valuable tool for sustainable nutrient and acid management in agricultural systems. [@xu-2023-model-based-optimal]  `degree: 1` `citations: 0`

Future scenarios of land cover and climate change in southwest China were analyzed to assess the susceptibility of shallow landslides. The study found that both antecedent rainfall and event rainfall will increase in magnitude in the future, and there will be significant changes in land use and land cover, including increased forest cover and decreased farming land. The negative impact of climate change on landslide susceptibility outweighs the stabilizing effect of land cover change, leading to decreased stability in the study area. These findings contribute to understanding and mitigating landslide risks in the context of land use planning and climate change mitigation.

Modelling the probability of rainfall-induced shallow landslides in a changing climate in Otta, Central Norway, we analyzed slope stability conditions considering present and future scenarios, taking into account changes in precipitation, uncertainty in model parameters, and evaluating the contributing factors to model output and uncertainty. Using a hydrological-stability model, we studied the hydrological control on shallow landslides in different precipitation regimes, including climatic settings, extreme events, and antecedent precipitation conditions. By employing the Monte Carlo approach and conducting sensitivity analysis, we determined probabilities of failure for present and future conditions, revealing that changes in stability conditions only occur when the effect of antecedent precipitation is not considered. However, due to uncertainties in predicted extreme precipitation events, soil parameters, and antecedent precipitation conditions, accurate estimation of changes in stability conditions for shallow landslides is not possible.
